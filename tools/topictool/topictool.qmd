# Topic-Model Tool

This notebook-based tool accompanies the [Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL) tutorial *Topic Modelling R*](tutorials/topicmodels/topicmodels.html). 

## Using your own data

<div class="warning" style='padding:0.1em; background-color: rgba(215,209,204,.3); color:#51247a'>
<span>
<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
To <b>use your own data</b>, click on the folder called <b>`MyTexts`</b> (it is in the menu to the left of the screen) and then simply drag and drop your txt-files into the folder. <br>When you then execute the code chunk below, you will upload your own data and you can then use it in this notebook.<br>You can upload <b>only txt-files</b> (simple unformatted files created in or saved by a text editor)! <br>The notebook assumes that you upload some form of text data - not tabular data!<br><br>
<b>IMPORTANT: topic modeling works best if the texts are neither too short nor too long. Typically  paragraphs work best (texts above sentence level and below article length).</b>
