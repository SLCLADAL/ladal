<p>Date: 16 January 2024</p>
<p>Context: AcqVA Aurora workshop</p>
<p>Join this half-day workshop on advanced dimension reduction methods (t-SNE and UMAP) and creating interactive Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>This workshop will show you how to implement t-SNE and UMAP methods for reducing the number of dimensions in your data and how you can generate and make use of Jupyter notebooks from your R notebooks, and make use of GitHub and Binder to convert them into publicly accessible, interactive notebooks that allow others to reproduce your analysis by the push of a button. By combining Jupyter notebooks with Binder and GitHub, you can enhance transparency, reproducibility, and make use of online computing capabilities, allowing you to easily share and replicate analyses.</p>
<p>Through hands-on exercises and examples, participants will acquire the skills to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Perform t-SNE and UMAP dimension reduction</p></li>
<li><p>create reproducible Jupyter notebooks from their R notebooks</p></li>
<li><p>connect their RStudio projects to GitHub and push the contents of their project folders to GitHub</p></li>
<li><p>Use Binder to convert a GitHub repository into interactive, publicly accessible notebooks that other can use to interactively reproduce analyses and even edit and change code to explore the data and analyses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Basic knowledge of R and familiarity with Jupyter notebooks are recommended. Having a GitHub account is mandatory. Please bring your laptop with RStudio installed, along with relevant linguistic datasets for hands-on exercises.</p>

<p>Date: 17 June 2022</p>
<p>This workshop consists of two parts. The first part of the workshop focuses on loading and working with tabular data R. In this part of the workshop, we will learn how to load, inspect, process, and summarize tabulated data. The second part of the workshop focuses tree-based models in R, such as conditional inference trees, random forests, and Boruta, which have become more prominent in the language science over the past decade. This part will discuss the underlying logic of tree-based models, how they can be implemented in R, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p><img src="./images/web.jpeg" class="img-fluid" style="float:right; padding:10px;width:40.0%"></p>
<p>The workshop <strong>Computational Thinking in the Humanities</strong> was a 3-hour online workshop featuring two plenary talks, lightning presentations, as well as a panel discussion. The workshop is co-organized by the <a href="https://www.atap.edu.au/"><strong>Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP)</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.kielipankki.fi/organization/fin-clariah/"><strong>FIN-CLARIAH</strong></a> and its UEF representatives, and the <a href="https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/"><strong>Australian Digital Observatory</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The workshop has received financial supported from the <a href="https://hass.uq.edu.au/Digital-Cultures-and-Societies"><strong>Digital Cultures and Societies Hub</strong></a> at the <a href="https://uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop took place</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Sep.&nbsp;1, 2022</strong>, 5-8pm Queensland, 10am-1pm Finland, 8-11am UK.</p>
<p><strong>Event Description</strong></p>
<p>Computers and software are now inescapable in our daily lives - while much of our research might now be enabled or mediated by these computers, that doesn’t mean that our research practices have fundamentally changed - a digital library is still recognisable as a library.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does computational thinking mean for the humanities?<br>
</li>
<li>How can the humanities embrace computing and computational approaches on their own terms, and avoid simply scavenging and repurposing approaches developed within other fields?<br>
</li>
<li>How do we resist having our “problems” “solved” for us?<br>
</li>
<li>What are the methodological and epistemological foundations of a field that is both computational and of the humanities - does computation actually change the nature of what we do?</li>
</ul>
<p>This international workshop will bring together speakers to address this topic, drawing on perspectives from several fields. We hope that this event will prompt reflection, introduce new ideas, spark discussions and plant the seeds for future collaborations.</p>

<p>This talk was recorded March 7, 2022, as part of the LADAL Webinar Series 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Recording link</strong>: https://youtu.be/sW70Y6XDiRA</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
In this talk I discuss the results of three studies on the geographical diffusion of lexical innovation, all of which are based on the analysis of multibillion word corpora of Twitter data collected between 2013 and 2014. In this first study, I track the spread of new words across the US. In the second study, I zoom in and look at how these same words spread out across New York City. In the third study, I consider how lexical items from Multicultural London English have diffused across the UK. In all cases, I show that the spread of lexical innovation is not only constrained by physical distance and population density, as predicted by the Wave and Gravity Models, but by cultural patterns and boundaries.

<p><strong>The Archive as Subject rather than Source: a Roadmap to Constructing and Disseminating a Digital Archive</strong></p>

<p>This talk was recorded May 9, 2022, as part of the LADAL Webinar Series 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Recording link</strong>: https://youtu.be/-dcwbKZuzDU</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Archives are valuable resources in historical media and communication research. Unfortunately, many collections are hard to find and access, and have not been properly digitised and described. In this paper we argue that computational methods are instrumental in engaging with and digitising archive materials, even though these methods introduce problems of their own. More specifically, we articulate critical thinking on the concept of ‘the archive’ with a discussion of the key decisions and practical hurdles encountered in the construction and digitisation of an archive. This is illustrated by a mid-sized project based on records of communications between the Pentagon and CIA Entertainment Liaison Offices (ELO) and audiovisual productions companies around the world, which are key in revealing influence of the US military on the entertainment industry. However, rather than discussing every step in the project in minute detail, we maximise the relevance for a broad readership by distilling a generic roadmap and key recommendations that cover all stages of strategic decision-making in archive construction and digitisation, as well as demonstrating the required generic technical implementations.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The focus of the current seminar will be a (very) brief introduction to longitudinal data and their analysis focusing on regression. To start with we will look at longitudinal data and different designs for collecting such data. We will then look at some empirical observations and why they occur before turning our attention to simple linear regression and why it is generally not appropriate to use it for the analysis of such data. Understanding the above is very important but also a neglected aspect of longitudinal data. We will then, very briefly, introduce two methods for appropriately analysing such data: (i) mixed models and (ii) Generalised Estimating Equations.</p>

<p><img src="./images/marcopolo.png" class="img-fluid" style="float:right; padding:10px;width:45.0%"></p>
<p>This talk was recorded September 26, 2022, as part of the LADAL Webinar Series 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Recording link</strong>: https://youtu.be/oJFmw1Sy7iE</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Marco Polo was born into a wealthy Venetian merchant family in 1254 and at the age of 17 he embarked on an epic journey to Asia, as one of the first westerners to ever visit China. When he returned 24 years later he recorded his extensive travels in a book – publishing possibly the first travel guide ever – and introducing Europeans to Central Asia and China.</p>
<p>In our talk we show our preliminary work on the analysis of travel literature using Marco Polo’s travel diaries as an example. First, we show the annotation and automatic extraction of important landmarks. On the other hand, we propose an extraction procedure that can uncover possible movements and route segments from the text. This is complemented by a geo-visualization that does not only show a map, but rather works with the spatial situation and terrain models, so that the landscape context can provide complementary information for the text itself. With this work we hope to contribute to a better understanding of historical journeys.</p>

<p>This talk was recorded November 7, 2022, as part of the LADAL Webinar Series 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Recording link</strong>: https://youtu.be/UwIgWD5pWzQ</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Linguistics is undergoing a rapid shift away from significance tests towards approaches emphasizing parameter estimation, such as linear mixed effects models. Alongside this shift, another revolution is underway: away from using p-values as part of a “null ritual” (Gigerenzer, 2004) towards Bayesian models. Both shifts can nicely be dealt with the ‘brms’ package (Bürkner, 2017). After briefly reviewing why we shouldn’t blindly follow the “null ritual” of significance testing, I will demonstrate how easy it is to fit quite complex models using this package. I will also talk about how mixed models are used in different subfields of linguistics (Winter &amp; Grice, 2021), and why established practices such as dropping random slopes for non-converging models are a further reason to go Bayesian. Finally, I will briefly touch on issues relating to prior specification, especially the importance of weakly informative priors to prevent overfitting.</p>

<p><strong>Found in Translation - What can we learn from translations about languages and human communication</strong></p>
<p><img src="./images/Fotran.png" class="img-fluid" style="float:right; padding:10px;width:45.0%"></p>
<p>This talk was recorded December 5, 2022, as part of the LADAL Webinar Series 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Recording link</strong>: https://youtu.be/feF987aX5s8</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The goal of language technology is to create computational models that can understand and generate language in a way humans can do. One of the strategies is to learn such communication abilities from real-world data and in that way somewhat resemble humans and their capability of picking up language skills through practical experience. However, the crucial question is what kind of experience is needed and what kind of tasks have to be practiced to build an understanding of human language signals. We are currently running a project that studies the use of translations that form natural semantic mirrors of original texts in other languages as a means of providing information about the underlying latent meaning that corresponds to the observable language string. The big question is what kind of abstractions can be learned from this cross-lingual signal and how much does that reflect our knowledge about linguistic properties on various levels. Part of this question is how much language diversity can be used to push abstraction levels even further. In this talk I will present some of our results and try to connect this kind of neural “black-box” NLP with questions in general linguistics and cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, Stefan gave a brief and relatively practical introduction to an approach called MuPDAR(F) (for <em>Multifactorial Prediction and Deviation Analysis using Regressions/Random Forests</em>) that he developed (see <span class="citation" data-cites="gries2014using">Gries and Deshors</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="gries2014subject">Gries and Adelman</span> for the first applications). The main part of the talk involved using a version of the data in <span class="citation" data-cites="gries2014subject">Gries and Adelman</span> to exemplify how this protocol works and how it can be done in R. Second, Stefan discussed a few recent extensions proposed in <span class="citation" data-cites="gries2020theresmore">Gries and Deshors</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="griestamupdar">Gries (<a href="#ref-griestamupdar" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>, which have to do with</p>

<li><p>how to deal with situations with more than two linguistic choices,</p></li>
<li><p>how predictions are made, and</p></li>
<li><p>how deviations are quantified.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, he briefly comment on exploring individual variation among the target speakers (based on <span class="citation" data-cites="gries2021examining">Gries and Wulff</span>).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Shana Poplack has set benchmarks for the development of corpora since the early 1980s. Poplack (2015, p.&nbsp;921) maintains that the “gold standard remains the (standard sociolinguistic-style) … corpus”. The aim of producing corpora using these principles is to avoid the ‘cherry picking’ approach which dominates much of the theoretical literature. Poplack and her team have created the Ottawa-Hull Corpus which consists of 3.5 million words of informal speech data. This corpus is enormous and beyond the capabilities of a single linguist in a small language community. This talk offers suggestions for corpus development in the field that follow Poplack’s principles, but also shows where compromises can be made. I discuss the method developed during the Gurindji Kriol project called ‘peer elicitation’. It supplements Poplack’s gold standard of naturally occurring speech with semi-formal elicitation to ensure sufficient data for quantitative analyses.

This talk introduces the Text Crunching Centre (TCC) which is a Computational Linguistics and Digital Humanities service hosted at the University of Zurich, and a collaboration partner of LADAL. We present a selection of our case studies using text analytics, from cognitive linguistics, social, political and historical studies. We show how stylistics, document classification, topic modelling, conceptual maps, distributional semantics and eye-tracking can offer new perspectives. Our case studies include language and age, learner language, the history of medicine, democratisation, religion, and attitudes to migration. We conclude with an outlook to the future of text analytics.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
In this <em>golden age of Indigenous television</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="sebbens2020golden">(<a href="#ref-sebbens2020golden" role="doc-biblioref">Sebbens 2020, February 2</a>)</span>, it is important to analyze Indigenous-authored drama series, so that we can move beyond ‘a deficit perspective’ <span class="citation" data-cites="charity2020racial">(<a href="#ref-charity2020racial" role="doc-biblioref">Charity Hudley, Mallison, and Bucholtz, 216</a>)</span> in relation to mediated linguistic diversity. This talk presents a corpus linguistic case study of Australian Aboriginal English (AAE) lexis as present in three such Indigenous-authored television series: <em>Redfern Now</em>, <em>Cleverman</em>, and <em>Mystery Road</em>. For television viewers, mediated AAE can be an important source of information, especially if they do not regularly interact with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people. This would be the case for many Australians, and even more so for international viewers of Australian television series. All three analyzed series were exported overseas and thus have both Australian and international audiences. Using lexical profiling analysis [AntWordProfiler; <span class="citation" data-cites="anthony2013antword">Anthony</span>] in combination with qualitative concordance analysis, the talk identifies and compares the use of AAE lexis across the three series. Analysis of frequency and distribution will pinpoint words that appear to be particularly significant lexical resources in mediated AAE. The talk will be framed through the notion of diversity, as conceptualised in relation to television series.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Bayesian inference is becoming increasingly popular in linguistic research. In this talk I will compare frequentist (maximum likelihood) and Bayesian approaches to generalized linear mixed-effects regression, which is <em>de facto</em> the standard method for testing linguistic hypotheses about linguistic variation. The main advantages of Bayesian inference include an opportunity to test the research hypothesis directly, instead of trying to reject the null hypothesis. One can also use information from previous research as priors for subsequent models, which helps to overcome the recent crisis of reproducibility. This also enables one to use smaller samples. It helps to solve such problems as overfitting, data separation and convergence issues, which often arise when one fits generalized mixed-effect models with complex structure. These advantages will be illustrated by a multifactorial case study of <em>help</em> + (<em>to</em>-)infinitive in US magazines, as in the example <em>These simple tips will help you (to) survive the Zombie apocalypse</em>.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Web-based studies are an increasingly popular and attractive alternative to lab- and field-based studies, enabling remote data collection for a rapidly growing variety of (psycho-)linguistic methods ranging from acceptability judgment tasks and self-paced reading to interactive group designs and the Visual World paradigm. Most platforms for building and hosting online studies are proprietary and subscription-based (e.g., Gorilla, Pavlovia, and FindingFive), but there also exist various free, open-source tools for writing and managing studies on your own server. This talk gives a practical introduction to building and hosting studies using jsPsych <span class="citation" data-cites="leeuw2015jspsych">(<a href="#ref-leeuw2015jspsych" role="doc-biblioref">De Leeuw</a>)</span> and JATOS <span class="citation" data-cites="lange2015jatos">(<a href="#ref-lange2015jatos" role="doc-biblioref">Lange, Kühn, and Filevich</a>)</span>, by demonstrating a <em>speedrun</em> of the entire process: from an empty file in a code editor, to distributing URLs to participants.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
The idea that you can duplicate an experiment and get the same conclusion is the basis for all scientific discoveries. Reproducible research is data analysis that starts with the raw data and offers a transparent workflow to arrive at the same results and conclusions. However not all studies are replicable due to lack of information on the process. Therefore, reproducibility in research is extremely important.<br>
Researchers genuinely want to make their research more reproducible, but sometimes don’t know where to start and often don’t have the available time to investigate or establish methods on how reproducible research can speed up every day work. We aim for the philosophy “Be better than you were yesterday”. Reproducibility is a process, and we highlight there is no expectation to go from beginner to expert in a single workshop. Instead, we offer some steps you can take towards the reproducibility path following our Steps to Reproducible Research self paced program.

<p><strong>Neurocognitive effects of bilingual experience</strong></p>
<p><img src="./images/polar.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="float:right; padding:10px;width:40.0%"></p>
<p>This talk was recorded July 28, 2021, as part of the LADAL Opening Webinar Series 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Recording on YouTube</strong>: https://youtu.be/wVBkUSPQFUw</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Much research over the past two decades shows that bilingualism affects brain structure, function, and potentially domain-general cognition <span class="citation" data-cites="bialystok2017bilingadapt pliatsikas2019understanding">(see e.g., <a href="#ref-bialystok2017bilingadapt" role="doc-biblioref">Bialystok</a>; <a href="#ref-pliatsikas2019understanding" role="doc-biblioref">Pliatsikas</a>)</span>. The specificity of these effects, however, has become the subject of significant debate in recent years, in large part due to variability of findings across studies <span class="citation" data-cites="leivada2020phantom">(see <a href="#ref-leivada2020phantom" role="doc-biblioref">Leivada et al.</a> for review)</span>. In this talk, we will introduce our research programs within the <a href="https://site.uit.no/polar/"><em>Psycholinguistics of Language Representation</em></a> (PoLaR) lab that addresses the juxtaposition of data and argumentation. Our work is guided by the principle that although bilingual effects are existent, they are conditional. In other words, bilingualism per se is not a sufficient condition for relevant effects on neurocognition. We will review our work that is generally designed to test the hypothesis that specific experience-based factors (EBFs) variably affect neural activity and plasticity in brain regions and pathways implicated in language- and executive control across the lifespan. We present results from a series of MRI studies showing a specificity of neural adaptations to different EBFs <span class="citation" data-cites="deluca2019immersion deluca2019redefining deluca2020duration">(<a href="#ref-deluca2019immersion" role="doc-biblioref">DeLuca, Rothman, and Pliatsikas</a>; <a href="#ref-deluca2019redefining" role="doc-biblioref">DeLuca et al.</a>, <a href="#ref-deluca2020duration" role="doc-biblioref"></a>)</span> in younger adults. We will also present data from older adults, showing similar EBF effects in healthy cognitive ageing <span class="citation" data-cites="voitseffects">(<a href="#ref-voitseffects" role="doc-biblioref">Voits, Robson, and Pliatsikas submitted</a>)</span> and with mild cognitive impairment <span class="citation" data-cites="voitsbilingualism">(<a href="#ref-voitsbilingualism" role="doc-biblioref">Voits et al. in prep.</a>)</span>. EBFs related to duration of bilingual language use correlate to neurocognitive adaptations suggesting increased efficiency in language control, whereas those related to extent of additional language use correlate with adaptations suggesting increased control demands. Considered together, these data suggest that the brain strives to be maximally effective and efficient in language processing and control, which in turn affects domain-general cognitive processes proportionally to degree of engagement with bilingual experiences. The work in older populations leads to the conclusion that degree of engagement with bilingualism is a catalyst for cognitive/brain reserve and thus has some real-world benefits in aging.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Linguists have adopted several methods from data science, but network analysis has been used rather less than others even though it is a useful tool. This presentation will introduce the basics of using network analysis, discussing the types of problems for which the method is useful, the kinds of data which are amenable to analysis, and the graphical outputs which can be achieved. These points will be illustrated with several examples from different areas of linguistic research, as well as with an example with data concerning a social network.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Speech recognition (ASR) technologies can be useful to accelerate transcription of language recordings, and to provide new insights into corpora. ASR tools are available now for hundreds of languages from commercial providers and can be trained for languages that are not commercially supported. However, there are significant hurdles to using ASR tools, from the preparation of data through to the training of the systems. This presentation introduces the motivations and process of co-designing Elpis, a speech recognition system built to be usable by ordinary working linguits. We discuss some examples of using Elpis with a range of low-resource language corpora, and how the co-design process can be used to benefit other language technologies.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Societal big data today provides a large source of language data in naturalistic settings. Such data have substantially enlarged pools of evidence in various fields in social sciences and the humanities. In linguistics, one direct impact has been the emergence of computational sociolinguistics, a field that intersects sociolinguistics with computational techniques.</p>
<p>However, social big data have one major limitation, at least when it comes to computational sociolinguistics. This limitation, quite surprisingly, concerns the lack of social background information. Researchers have no direct access to background information (author’s gender, social layer, education, occupation, etc.), and it is difficult to combine evidence from social media with rich social information for the simple reason that such information is not available for proprietary reasons. If some social information is available, it is often self-reported and therefore prone to inaccuracies. Or, it is ethically unsustainable to link big language data with socio-cultural information (cf.&nbsp;the Cambridge Analytica scandal).</p>
This talk introduces a method that is being developed in my SOCOS research group. The method builds on social network theory and utilizes freely available interaction data. These data can be quantified easily through a set of algorithms and used as proxies for social parameters. One downside is that it requires some degree of technical competence to extract these data, which can easily be accomplished through interdisciplinary partnerships in digital humanities environments.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
This paper explores how corpus technology and DDL pedagogy can support secondary schoolgirls’ reporting of an observed science experiment through a written research report, focusing particularly on how corpora were used to develop receptive and productive knowledge of passive voice constructions. A pre-test of the grammaticality of passive constructions was conducted, alongside a diagnostic pre-instruction written report requiring the retelling of an observed science experiment were collected from 60 Year 9-10 girls at a high school in Australia. During a full 10-week term, students were given guided individual homework tasks and short in-class pair/group DDL activities focusing on passive voice constructions, using freely available online corpus applications such as SketchEngine. Following this treatment, a post-test was conducted while an additional written research report was collected. Questionnaire and interview data was also collected to determine the perceptions of younger female learners and their teachers regarding their engagement with corpora and DDL for improving knowledge and use of passive constructions over time. The data suggest that while the DDL treatment did not result in increased receptive knowledge of the grammaticality of passive voice constructions, their productive use of the passive was significantly improved. Moreover, when students were given the opportunity to use corpora to check their intuitions in the post-test, they produced accurate responses over 75% of the time. Qualitative stakeholder perceptions of improved disciplinary linguistic knowledge, increased data management skills, and positive engagement with “science” were also found in the survey/interview data, although a number of challenges at the technical and conceptual levels for DDL still remain.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Social sciences have opened up to text mining, i.e., a set of methods to automatically identify semantic structures in large document collections. However, the methods have often been limited to a statistical analysis of textual data, strongly limiting the scope of possible research questions. The more complex concepts central to the social sciences such as arguments, frames, narratives and claims still are mainly studied using manual content analyses in which the knowledge needed to apply a category (i.e.&nbsp;to “code”) is verbally described in a codebook and implicit in the coder’s own background knowledge. Supervised machine learning provides an approach to scale-up this coding process to large datasets. Recent advantages in neural network-based natural language processing allow for pretraining language models that can transfer semantic knowledge from unsupervised text collections to specific automatic coding problems. With deep learning models such as BERT automatic coding of context-sensitive semantics with substantially lowered efforts in training data generation comes within reach to content analysis. The talk will introduce to the applied usage of these technologies along with two interdisciplinary research projects studying hate speech and counter speech in German Facebook postings, and information extraction for the analysis of the coverage of protest events in local news media.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Our presentation falls into three parts. It begins with Terttu’s brief introduction to the Research Unit for Variation, Contacts and Change in English (VARIENG), its past, present and future, and its current open-access resources. In addition, the talk presents two short cases studies touching on the methodology of corpus linguistics from different perspectives. The first one (by Turo) discusses how the availability of massive text archives may hold great promise for corpus linguistic work, but they may also present considerable methodological challenges for users <span class="citation" data-cites="hiltunen2017evidence">(see e.g. <a href="#ref-hiltunen2017evidence" role="doc-biblioref">Hiltunen, McVeigh, and Säily</a>)</span>. In focus here are some specific problems related to the diachronic British Library Newspapers database, and how those problems might be addressed in the context of register analysis and the study of linguistic variation. The second case study (by Aatu) looks into the role of text length in register-internal variation by analyzing a big data sample of social media comments. Different registers seem to exhibit different kinds of internal functional variation by text length (as shown by the illustration).

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<em>AntConc</em> is a widely used desktop corpus tool that has been downloaded over 2.5 million times since its first release in the early 2000s. Today, it is used by researchers, teachers, and learners in over 140 countries and its tutorial videos have been viewed over 500,000 times. AntConc has a relatively easy-to-use design and works especially well with small corpora of under a few million words. However, it begins to struggle when processing larger corpora and offers relatively few statistics for advanced analysis. In this talk, I will introduce a new version of AntConc (version 4.0) that has been built from the ground up to addresses these limitations. The new version includes features that allow the software to be easily extended, and it produces results in a way that allows for smooth data interoperability with other tools and scripts. I will also discuss various issues that need to be considered when developing software for a broad user base, which should be of interest to both users and developers of software tools.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Computational linguistics offers promising tools for tracking language change in diachronic corpora. These tools exploit distributional semantic models, both old and new. DSMs tend to perform well at the level of lexical semantics but are more difficult to fine-tune when it comes to capturing grammatical meaning.</p>
<p>I present ways in which the above can be improved. I start from well-trodden methodological paths implemented in diachronic construction grammar: changes in the collocational patterns of a linguistic unit reflect changes in meaning/function; distributional word representations can be supplemented with frequency-based methods. I move on to show that when meaning is apprehended with predictive models (e.g.&nbsp;word2vec), one can trace semantic shifts with greater explanatory power than with count models. Although this idea may sound outdated from the perspective of NLP, it actually goes great ways from the viewpoint of theory-informed corpus linguistics.</p>
I illustrate the above with several case studies, one of which involves complex locative prepositions in the Corpus of Historical American English. I conclude my talk by defending the idea that NLP, with its focus on computational efficiency, and corpus-linguistics, with its focus on tools that maximize data inspection, have much to gain from getting closer.

<p><a href="https://smartool.github.io/smartool-rus-eng/">SMARTool</a>: SMARTool is a language-learning software tool assisting English-speaking learners of Russian.</p>
<p><a href="https://dataverse.no/dataverse/trolling">TROLLING</a> is a repository of data, code, and other related materials used in linguistic research. The repository is open access, which means that all information is available to everyone. All postings are accompanied by searchable metadata that identify the researchers, the languages and linguistic phenomena involved, the statistical methods applied, and scholarly publications based on the data (where relevant).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
Many languages have rich inflectional morphology signaling grammatical categories such as case, number, tense, etc. Rich morphology presents a challenge for L2 learners because even a basic vocabulary of a few thousand words can entail mastery of over 100,000 word forms. However, only a handful of the potential forms of a given word occur frequently, while the remainder are rare. Access to digital corpora makes it possible to determine which forms of any given word are of highest frequency, as well as what grammatical and collocational contexts motivate those few frequent forms, facilitating strategically focused language learning tools. Corpus analysis of the frequency distributions of inflectional forms provide linguists with added insights into the function of languages. The results achieved primarily by using correspondence analysis of Russian material are potentially portable to any language with rich inflectional morphology.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This talk introduces our new project, Rise of Commercial Society and Eighteenth-Century Publishing, by discussing its premises and a pilot study. Combining historical sociolinguistics with intellectual history, book history and data science, the project studies the eighteenth-century print media and publishing networks that enabled the rise of commercial society and its conceptualization in the eighteenth-century Anglophone world. The chief focus is on Scottish, transatlantic and French influences on British print media.</p>
A key innovation in our project is that we connect the study of eighteenth-century publishing networks with that of language variation and change to gain results that are of interest to both linguists and historians. To do this, we link enriched bibliographic metadata with full-text sources for historical-sociolinguistic analysis. Our main interest is in charting the use and spread of new vocabulary in the networks to better understand how the discourse develops over time. Instead of focusing on well-known authors, we will identify influencers in a data-driven way; these can also be printers or publishers. By combining network analysis with text mining and social metadata on the actors, we are able to conduct large-scale analyses of how linguistic and stylistic changes spread across social groups in eighteenth-century public discourse.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Scientific progress has long rested on the often unstated assumptions that research is reproducible (i.e., independent analysts can recreate the results claimed by the original authors by using the original data and analysis techniques), replicable (the results claimed by analysts extends beyond the original data to some wider population or phenomenon), and robust (the findings reported by analysts are not ovely sensitive to assumptions in their model). Recently, however, there have been growing concerns about the extent to which current research practices can meet these assumptions. In this talk, I’ll present a high-level discussion of these issues, defining the key terms, demonstrating how and why questions have been raised about why work may not be as reproducible, replicable, or robust as we may wish, and offer some tentative suggestions for and examples of improving the reproducibility, replicability, and robustness of linguistic research in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, we attempt two tasks. Firstly, we dispel some of the mystery around phylogenetic comparative methods and highlight their fundamental relationship to matters of enduring concern in linguistic typology. Secondly, we aim to show how linguists can carry out essential tasks using phylogenetic methods, easily.</p>
<p>We begin by laying out the historical commonalities between typology and comparative biology, and the breakthrough insight that makes phylogenetic comparative methods distinct. This is followed by an overview of some fundamental phylogenetic concepts and tools. Finally, we illustrate these with a typological case study from the Pama-Nyungan languages. Our talk is accompanied by online interactive materials, demonstrating how phylogenetic comparative methods can be incorporated into everyday typological workflows.</p>

<p>This talk was recorded Nov.&nbsp;11, 2021, as part of the LADAL Opening Webinar Series 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Recording on YouTube</strong>: https://youtu.be/YBC_y12bcF8</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, linguists have focused on reconstructing earlier regional and social varieties of English through the quantitative analysis of emigrant letters and other written documents. As demonstrated in these studies this type of material can provide important, quantifiable data on certain features proper to a particular variety, thus allowing for the reconstruction of some of the features proper to that variety prior to the collection of spoken data.</p>
<p>The aim of this talk is to present the Corpus of Irish English Correspondence (CORIECOR), a corpus of personal letters written between 1750-1940. The corpus contains some 4700 texts (approx. 3 million words), of which 4100 (2.5m words) are correspondence maintained between Irish emigrants and their relatives, friends and contacts. The letters were sent mainly between Ireland and other countries such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand, Argentina and Australia, and therefore provide an empirical base for studies of historical change in Irish English and its contribution to other major overseas varieties. In order to explore the use of a corpus like this for the study of Irish English, the talk will show some recent findings.</p>
