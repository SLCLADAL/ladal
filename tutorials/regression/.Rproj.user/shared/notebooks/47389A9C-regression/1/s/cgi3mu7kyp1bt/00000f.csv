"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict Score with Group (formula: Score ~ Group). The model explains a
statistically significant and moderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.23, F(1, 58) = 17.55, p < .001, adj. R2 = 0.22). The
model's intercept, corresponding to Group = A, is at 14.93 (95% CI [13.86, 16.00], t(58) = 27.94, p < .001). Within this
model:

  - The effect of Group [B] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -3.17, 95% CI [-4.68, -1.65], t(58) = -4.19, p
< .001; Std. beta = -0.96, 95% CI [-1.41, -0.50])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
