"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict money with status and attraction (formula: money ~ (status +
attraction)^2). The model explains a statistically significant and substantial proportion of variance (R2 = 0.86, F(3, 94)
= 188.36, p < .001, adj. R2 = 0.85). The model's intercept, corresponding to status = Relationship and attraction =
Interested, is at 99.15 (95% CI [92.01, 106.30], t(94) = 27.56, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of status [Single] is statistically significant and positive (beta = 55.85, 95% CI [45.65, 66.06], t(94) =
10.87, p < .001; Std. beta = 1.19, 95% CI [0.97, 1.41])
  - The effect of attraction [NotInterested] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -47.66, 95% CI [-57.76,
-37.56], t(94) = -9.37, p < .001; Std. beta = -1.02, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.80])
  - The effect of status [Single] Ã— attraction [NotInterested] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -59.46, 95%
CI [-73.89, -45.03], t(94) = -8.18, p < .001; Std. beta = -1.27, 95% CI [-1.58, -0.96])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
