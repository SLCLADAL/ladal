"1","We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict Prepositions with Date (formula: Prepositions ~ Date). The model
explains a statistically significant and very weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.01, F(1, 535) = 5.68, p = 0.017, adj. R2
= 8.66e-03). The model's intercept, corresponding to Date = 0, is at 132.19 (95% CI [130.54, 133.84], t(535) = 157.62, p <
.001). Within this model:

  - The effect of Date is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.02, 95% CI [3.05e-03, 0.03], t(535) = 2.38, p =
0.017; Std. beta = 0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.19])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
