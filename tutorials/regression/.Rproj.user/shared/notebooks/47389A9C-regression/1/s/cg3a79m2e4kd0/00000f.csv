"1","We fitted a logistic model (estimated using ML) to predict EH with Age and Gender (formula: EH ~ Age + Gender). The model's
explanatory power is weak (Tjur's R2 = 0.03). The model's intercept, corresponding to Age = Young and Gender = Men, is at
-0.23 (95% CI [-0.28, -0.19], p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of Age [Old] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.83, 95% CI [-0.90, -0.77], p < .001; Std.
beta = -0.83, 95% CI [-0.90, -0.77])
  - The effect of Gender [Women] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.42, 95% CI [-0.47, -0.37], p < .001;
Std. beta = -0.42, 95% CI [-0.47, -0.37])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence
Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald z-distribution approximation.
