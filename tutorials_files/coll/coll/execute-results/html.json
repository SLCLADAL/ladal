This tutorial focuses on co-occurrence and collocations of words. Collocations are words that occur very frequently together. For example, *Merry Christmas* is a collocation because *merry* and *Christmas* occur more frequently together than would be expected by chance. This means that if you were to shuffle all words in a corpus and would then test the frequency of how often *merry* and *Christmas* co-occurred, they would occur significantly less often in the shuffled or randomized corpus than in a corpus that contain non-shuffled natural speech. \n\n# Co-occurrence and association {-}\n\nCollocations are combinations of words that frequently co-occur in a language, appearing together more often than would be expected by chance. \n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#51247a; color:#f2f2f2'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\n**LADAL TOOL** \n</p>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\nClick on this [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://binderhub.atap-binder.cloud.edu.au/v2/gh/SLCLADAL/interactive-notebooks-environment/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FSLCLADAL%252Finteractive-notebooks%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Finteractive-notebooks%252Fnotebooks%252Famtool.ipynb%26branch%3Dmain) badge to open an notebook-based tool <br>that calculates association measures and allows you to download the results.</p><br>\n<p style='margin-left:1em;'>\n</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\nWe need to differentiate between  \n\n\n+ **collocations**: words that are significantly attracted to one another and often occur together (but are not necessarily adjacent) such as *black* and *coffee*  \n\n+ **n-grams**: combinations of words that are adjacent as the bi-grams *This is*, *is a*, and *a sentence* that form the sentence *This is a sentence*  \n\n\nSuch word pairings or groupings exhibit a certain degree of naturalness and tend to form recurring patterns. They play a crucial role in language acquisition,  learning, fluency, and usage and they contribute to the natural and idiomatic expression of ideas. A typical example of a collocation is *Merry Christmas* because the words *merry* and *Christmas* occur together more frequently together than would be expected, if words were just randomly stringed together. Other examples of collocations include *strong coffee*, *make a decision*, or *take a risk*. Recognizing and understanding collocations is essential for language learners, as it enhances their ability to produce authentic and contextually appropriate language.\n\nIdentifying words pairs (w1 and w2) that collocate (i.e. collocations) and determining their association strength (a measure of how strongly attracted words are to each other) is based on the co-occurrence frequencies of word pairs in a contingency table (see below, *O* is short for *observed frequency*).\n\n|                   | w~2~ present  |     w~2~ absent |      |\n| :---              | :-----:       |   --------:     | ---  |\n| **w~1~ present**  | O~11~         | O~12~           |  = R~1~\n| **w~1~ absent**   | O~21~         | O~22~           |  = R~2~\n|                   |  = C~1~       |   = C~2~        |  = N |\n\n\nFrom this contingency table, we can calculate the frequencies that would be expected if the words did not show any attraction or repulsion  (see below, *E* is short for *expected frequency*).\n\n\n|                    | w~2~ present                      |     w~2~ absent |      |\n| :----------        | :--------:                        |  :--------:     | ---  |\n| **w~1~ present**   | E~11~ = (R~1~ * C~1~) / (N) | E~12~ =  (R~1~ * C~2~) / (N)      |  = R~1~\n| **w~1~ absent**    | E~21~ = (R~2~ * C~1~) / (N) | E~22~ =   (R~2~ * C~2~) / (N)     |  = R~2~\n|                    |  = C~1~                           |   = C~2~        |  = N |\n\n\n**Association measures** use the frequency information in the above contingency tables to evaluate the strength of attraction or repulsion between words. As such, association measures are statistical metrics used to quantify the strength and significance of the relationship between words within a collocation. These measures help assess how likely it is for two words to appear together more frequently than expected by chance. Several association measures are commonly used in collocation analysis, including:\n\n+    **Gries' AM**: Gries' AM [@gries2022some] is probably the best association measure that is on conditional probabilities. For information on how it is calculated, see @gries2022some. In contrast to other association measures, it has three main advantages: \n\n  + it takes into account that the association between word_1 and word_2 is not symmetric (word_1 may be more strongly attracted with word_2 than vice verse) - in sense it is very similar to &Delta;P  \n  + it is not affected by frequency as other association measures (which is a serious issue as association measures should reflect association strength and not frequency).  \n  + it is normalized as it takes into account that the possible range of values differs across elements (some words can have very high values while others cannot)\n\n\n+    **delta P (&Delta;P)**: &Delta;P [@ellis2007langac; @gries201350] is an association measure based on conditional probabilities that is implied in MS [@gries201350, 141]. &Delta;P has two advantages: it takes into account that the association between word_1 and word_2 is not symmetric (word_1 may be more strongly attracted with word_2 than vice verse) and it is not affected by frequency as other association measures (which is a serious issue as association measures should reflect association strength and not frequency) [see @gries2022some].\n\n\\[ \\Delta P_1 =  P(w_1 | w_2) = \\left( \\frac{O11}{R1} \\right)- \\left(\\frac{O21} {R2} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta P_2 =  P(w_2 | w_1)  = \\left( \\frac{O11}{C1} \\right) -\\left( \\frac{O21}{C2} \\right) \\]\n\n\n+    **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)**: PMI measures the likelihood of two words occurring together compared to their individual likelihoods of occurring separately. A higher PMI score suggests a stronger association.\n\n\\[ \\text{PMI}(w_1, w_2) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w_1 \\cap w_2)}{P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2)} \\right) \\]\n\n+    **Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR)**: LLR compares the likelihood of the observed word combination occurring with the expected likelihood based on the individual frequencies of the words. Higher LLR values indicate a more significant association (where \\(O_i\\) is the observed frequency and \\(E_i\\) is the expected frequency for each combination).\n\n   \\[ \\text{LLR}(w_1, w_2) = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\]\n\n   \n+    **Dice Coefficient**: This measure considers the co-occurrence of words and calculates the ratio of the overlap between the two words to the sum of their individual frequencies. The Dice coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating stronger association.\n\n   \\[ \\text{Dice}(w_1, w_2) = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{freq}(w_1 \\cap w_2)}{\\text{freq}(w_1) + \\text{freq}(w_2)} \\]\n\n+    **Chi-Square**: Chi-square measures the difference between the observed and expected frequencies of word co-occurrence. A higher chi-square value signifies a more significant association (where \\(O_i\\) is the observed frequency and \\(E_i\\) is the expected frequency for each combination).\n\n   \\[ \\chi^2(w_1, w_2) = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\]\n\n+    **t-Score**: The t-score is based on the difference between the observed and expected frequencies, normalized by the standard deviation. Higher T-scores indicate a stronger association.\n\n   \\[ \\text{t-Score}(w_1, w_2) = \\frac{\\text{freq}(w_1 \\cap w_2) - \\text{expected\\_freq}(w_1 \\cap w_2)}{\\sqrt{\\text{freq}(w_1 \\cap w_2)}} \\]\n\n+    **Mutual Information (MI)**: MI measures the reduction in uncertainty about one word's occurrence based on the knowledge of another word's occurrence. Higher MI values indicate a stronger association (where \\(P(w_1 \\cap w_2)\\) is the joint probability, and \\(P(w_1)\\) and \\(P(w_2)\\) are the individual probabilities).\n\n   \\[ \\text{MI}(w_1, w_2) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w_1 \\cap w_2)}{P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2)} \\right) \\]\n\n   \n   \n+    **Minimum Sensitivity (MS)**: The minimum sensitivity is 1 when W1 and W2 always occur together and never apart. It is 0 when W1 and W2 never occur together. A higher minimum sensitivity indicates a stronger dependence between the two words in a bigram [@pedersen1998dependent].\n\n   \\[ \\text{MS} = min\\left( P(w_1 | w_2) ,  P(w_2 | w_1) \\right) \\]\n\n\nThese association measures help researchers and language analysts identify meaningful and statistically significant collocations, assisting in the extraction of relevant information from corpora and improving the accuracy of collocation analysis in linguistic studies.\n\n\n**Preparation and session set up**\n\nThis tutorial is based on R.

frequency list of words that occur around a keyword (we use the keyword *selection* in this example but you can also choose a different word).\n\nfor this we use the `tokens_select` function (from the `quanteda` package) which has the following arguments: \n\n+ `x`: a text or collection of texts. The text needs to be tokenised, i.e. split it into individual words, which is why we use the *text* in the `tokens()` function. \n+ `pattern`: a keyword defined by a search pattern  \n+ `window`: the size of the context window (how many word before and after)  \n+ `valuetype`: the type of pattern matching  \n  + \"glob\" for \"glob\"-style wildcard expressions;  \n  + \"regex\" for regular expressions; or  \n  + \"fixed\" for exact matching  \n+ `selection`: a character to define if the key word should be retained in the resulting frequency list or if it should be removed. The argument offers two options  \n  + \"keep\"  \n  + \"remove\"  \n+ `case_insensitive`: logical; if TRUE, ignore case when matching a pattern or dictionary values\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

graphs](https://ladal.edu.au/net.html), or networks for short, are a powerful and versatile visual representation used to depict relationships or connections among various elements. Network graphs typically consist of nodes, representing individual entities, and edges, indicating the connections or interactions between these entities. Nodes can represent diverse entities such as words (collocates), interlocutors, objects, or concepts, while edges convey the relationships or associations between them.  \n\nHere we generate a basic network graph of the collocates of our keyword based on the fcm.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a network plot using the fcm\nquanteda.textplots::textplot_network(keyword_fcm,\n    # set the transparency of edges to 0.8 for visibility\n    edge_alpha = 0.8,\n    # set the color of edges to gray\n    edge_color = \"gray\",\n    # set the size of edges to 2 for better visibility\n    edge_size = 2,\n    # adjust the size of vertex labels\n    # based on the logarithm of row sums of the fcm\n    vertex_labelsize = log(rowSums(keyword_fcm))\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](coll_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Biplots {-}\n\nAn alternative way to display co-occurrence patterns are bi-plots which are used to display the results of a [Correspondence Analysis](https://ladal.edu.au/clust.html#2_Correspondence_Analysis). Bi-plots are useful, in particular, when one is not interested in one particular keyterm and its collocations but in the overall similarity of many terms. Semantic similarity in this case refers to a shared semantic and this distributional profile. As such, words can be deemed semantically similar if they have a similar co-occurrence profile - i.e. they co-occur with the same elements. Biplots can be used to visualize collocations because collocates co-occur and thus share semantic properties which renders then more similar to each other compared with other terms. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# perform correspondence analysis\nres.ca <- CA(as.matrix(keyword_fcm), graph = FALSE)\n# plot results\nfviz_ca_row(res.ca, repel = TRUE, col.row = \"gray20\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](coll_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# N-grams {-}\n\nN-grams  are contiguous sequences of N items (words, characters, or symbols) in a given text. The term *N* in N-grams refers to the number of items in the sequence. For example, a bigram (2-gram) consists of two consecutive items, a trigram (3-gram) consists of three, and so on. N-grams are widely used in natural language processing and text analysis to capture patterns and dependencies within a linguistic context. N-grams help analyze the frequency of word sequences in a corpus. This information can reveal common phrases, expressions, or patterns that occur frequently and that often represent  multiword expressions such as *New York*, *Prime Minister*, or *New South Wales*. Identifying such multiword expressions can be useful to fuse  compound words in subsequent steps of an analysis (e.g., combining *wheel chair* to *wheelchair* or *wheel-chair*). N-grams are fundamental in language modeling, where they are used to estimate the likelihood of a word given its context. This is especially important in predictive text applications and machine translation.\n\n## Identifying n-grams using quanteda {-}\n\nThe `quanteda` package [see @quanteda] offers excellent and very fast functions for extracting N-grams. It's a fun way to discover meaningful word pairs in your text! Below, we use the `textstat_collocations` function for extracting N-grams. This function uses the following main arguments\n\n+ `x`: a character, corpus, or tokens object.  \n+ `method`: association measure for detecting collocations. Currently this is limited to \"lambda\".  \n+ `size`: integer; the length of the ngram. The default is 2 - if you want to extract tri-grams set `size = 3` and if you want to extract four-grams set `size = 4` and so on.  \n+ `min_count`: numeric; minimum frequency of collocations that will be scored.  \n+ `smoothing`: numeric; a smoothing parameter added to the observed counts (default is 0.5).  \n+ `tolower`: logical; if TRUE, tokens are transformed to lower-case.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# concatenate the elements in the 'text' object\ntext %>%\n    paste0(collapse = \" \") %>%\n    # convert to lower case\n    tolower() %>%\n    # convert the

is surprisingly easy. In our example text, we'll craft a bi-gram list by doing something quite straightforward: taking each word and introducing it to the next word in line. The difference to the previous method is that we retain the original order of the bi-grams here.\n\nIn a first step, we split the text into words and remove any non-word characters.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# process the text\ntext %>%\n    # convert all text to lowercase\n    tolower() %>%\n    # remove non-word characters, keeping spaces\n    str_replace_all(\"[^[:alpha:][:space:]]*\", \"\") %>%\n    # remove punctuation\n    tm::removePunctuation() %>%\n    # squish consecutive spaces into a single space\n    stringr::str_squish() %>%\n    # split the text into individual words, separated by spaces\n    stringr::str_split(\" \") %>%\n    # unlist the result into a single vector of words  and save result in \"text_words\"\n    unlist() -> text_words\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, we generate a table with the N-grams(in our case bi-grams).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create data frame\ntext_bigrams <- data.frame(\n
