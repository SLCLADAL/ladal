All remaining errors are, of course, my own.] Regression models are among the most widely used quantitative methods in the language sciences to assess if and how predictors (variables or interactions between variables) correlate with a certain response. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://slcladal.github.io/images/yr_chili.jpg){width=15% style=\"float:right; padding:10px\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis tutorial is aimed at intermediate and advanced users of R with the aim of showcasing how to perform regression analysis using R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged analysis but rather to show and exemplify common regression types, model diagnostics, and model fitting using R. \n\n<br>\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\nThe entire R Notebook for the tutorial can be downloaded [**here**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/regression.Rmd).  If you want to render the R Notebook on your machine, i.e. knitting the document to html or a pdf, you need to make sure that you have R and RStudio installed and you also need to download the [**bibliography file**](https://slcladal.github.io/content/bibliography.bib) and store it in the same folder where you store the Rmd or the Rproj file. <br></p>\n<p style='margin-left:1em;'>\n</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\nRegression models are so popular because they can\n\n* incorporate many predictors in a single model (multivariate: allows to test the impact of one predictor while the impact of (all) other predictors is controlled for)\n\n* extremely flexible and and can be fitted to different types of predictors and dependent variables\n\n* provide output that can be easily interpreted\n\n* conceptually relative simple and not overly complex from a  mathematical perspective\n\nR offers various ready-made functions with which implementing different types of regression models is very easy.\n\nThe most widely use regression models are\n\n* linear regression (dependent variable is numeric, no outliers)\n\n* logistic regression (dependent variable is binary)\n\n* ordinal regression (dependent variable represents an ordered factor, e.g. Likert items)\n\n* multinomial regression (dependent variable is categorical)\n\n\nThe major difference between these types of models is that they take different types of dependent variables: linear regressions take numeric, logistic regressions take nominal variables, ordinal regressions take ordinal variables, and Poisson regressions take dependent variables that reflect counts of (rare) events. Robust regression, in contrast, is a simple multiple linear regression that is able to handle outliers due to a weighing procedure.\n\nIf regression models contain a random effect structure which is used to model nestedness or dependence among data points, the regression models are called *mixed-effect models*. regressions that do not have a random effect component to model  nestedness or dependence are referred to as fixed-effect regressions (we will have a closer look at the difference between fixed and random effects below).\n\nThere are two basic types of regression models: \n\n* fixed-effects regression models \n\n* mixed-effects regression models (which are fitted using the `lme4` package [@lme4] in this tutorial). \n\nFixed-effects regression models are models that assume a non-hierarchical data structure, i.e. data where data points are not nested or grouped in higher order categories (e.g. students within classes). The first part of this tutorial focuses on fixed-effects regression models while the second part focuses on mixed-effects regression models.\n\nThere exists a wealth of literature focusing on  regression analysis and the concepts it is based on.  For instance, there are @achen1982interpreting, @bortz2006statistik, @crawley2005statistics, @faraway2002practical, @field2012discovering (my personal favorite), @gries2021statistics, @levshina2015linguistics,  and @wilcox2009basic to name just a few. Introductions to regression modeling in R are @baayen2008analyzing, @crawley2012r, @gries2021statistics, or @levshina2015linguistics.\n\n**The basic principle**\n\nThe idea behind regression analysis is expressed formally in the equation below where $f_{(x)}$ is the $y$-value we want to predict, $\\alpha$ is the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the $y$-axis), $\\beta$ is the coefficient (the slope of the regression line). \n\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha + \\beta_{i}x + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\nTo understand what this means, let us imagine that we have collected information about the how tall people are and what they weigh. Now we want to predict the weight of people of a certain height - let's say 180cm.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div

If we plug in the numbers from the regression model below, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\n-93.77 + 0.98 ∗ 180 = 83.33 (kg)\n\\end{equation}\n\nA person who is 180cm tall is predicted to weigh 83.33kg. Thus, the predictions of the weights are visualized as the red line in the figure below. Such lines are called *regression lines*. Regression lines are those lines where the sum of the red lines should be minimal. The slope of the regression line is called *coefficient* and the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0 is called the *intercept*. Other important concepts in regression analysis are *variance* and *residuals*. *Residuals* are the distance between the line and the points (the red lines) and it is also called *variance*.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/intro01-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSome words about the plots in the figure above: the upper left panel shows the raw observed data (black dots). The upper right panel shows the mean weight (blue line) and the residuals (in red). residuals are the distances from the expected or predicted values to the observed values (in this case the mean is the most most basic model which we use to predict values while the observed values simply represent the actual data points). The lower left panel shows observed values and the regression line, i.e, that line which, when drawn through the data points, will have the lowest sum of residuals. The lower right panel shows the regression line and the residuals, i.e. the distances between the expected or predicted values to the actual observed values (in red). Note that the sum of residuals in the lower right panel is much smaller than the sum of residuals in the upper right panel. This suggest that considering Height is a good idea as it explains a substantive amount of residual error and reduces the sum of residuals (or variance).^[I'm very grateful to Antonio Dello Iacono who pointed out that the plots require additional discussion.]\n\nNow that we are familiar with the basic principle of regression modeling - i.e. finding the line through data that has the smallest sum of residuals, we will apply this to a linguistic example.\n\n**Preparation and session set up**\n\nThis tutorial is based on R. If you have not installed R or are new to it, you will find an introduction to and more information how to use R [here](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html).

Regressions are used when we try to understand how independent variables correlate with a dependent or outcome variable. So, if you want to investigate how a certain factor affects an outcome, then a regression is the way to go. We will have a look at two simple examples to understand what the concepts underlying a regression mean and how a regression works. The R code, that we will use, is adapted from many highly recommendable introductions which also focus on regression (among other types of analyses), for example, @gries2021statistics,  @winter2019statistics, @levshina2015linguistics, @winter2019statistics or @wilcox2009basic. @baayen2008analyzing is also very good but probably not the first book one should read about statistics but it is highly recommendable for advanced learners.\n\nAlthough the basic logic underlying regressions is identical to the conceptual underpinnings of *analysis of variance* (ANOVA), a related method, sociolinguists have traditionally favored regression analysis in their studies while ANOVAs have been the method of choice in psycholinguistics. The preference for either method is grounded in historical happenstances and the culture of these subdisciplines rather than in methodological reasoning. However, ANOVA are more restricted in that they can only take numeric dependent variables and they have stricter model assumptions that are violated more readily. In addition, a minor difference between regressions and ANOVA lies in the fact that regressions are based on the $t$-distribution while ANOVAs use the F-distribution (however, the F-value is simply the value of t squared or t^2^). Both t- and F-values report on the ratio between explained and unexplained variance.\n\nThe idea behind regression analysis is expressed formally in the equation below where$f_{(x)}$ is the y-value we want to predict, $\\alpha$ is the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0), $\\beta$ is the coefficient (the slope of the regression line). \n\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha + \\beta_{i}x + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn other words, to estimate how much some weights who is 180cm tall, we would multiply the coefficient (slope of the line) with 180 (x) and add the value of the intercept (point where line crosses the y-axis at x = 0). \n\nHowever, the idea behind regressions can best be described graphically: imagine a cloud of points (like the points in the scatterplot in the upper left panel below). Regressions aim to find that line which has the minimal summed distance between points and the line (like the line in the lower panels). Technically speaking, the aim of a regression is to find the line with the minimal deviance (or the line with the minimal sum of residuals). Residuals are the distance between the line and the points (the red lines) and it is also called *variance*. \n\nThus, regression lines are those lines where the sum of the red lines should be minimal. The slope of the regression line is called *coefficient* and the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0 is called the *intercept*.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/slr1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA word about standard errors (SE) is in order here because most commonly used statistics programs will provide SE values when reporting regression models. The SE is a measure that tells us how much the coefficients were to vary if the same regression were applied to many samples from the same population. A relatively small SE value therefore indicates that the coefficients will remain very stable if the same regression model is fitted to many different samples with identical parameters. In contrast, a large SE tells you that the model is volatile and not very stable or reliable as the coefficients vary substantially if the model is applied to many samples. \n\n\nMathematically, the SE is the standard deviation (SD) divided by the square root of the sample size (N) (see below).The SD is the square root of the deviance (that is, the SD is the square root of the sum of the mean $\\bar{x}$ minus each data point (x~i~) squared divided by the sample size (N) minus 1).\n\n\\begin{equation}\nStandard Error (SE) = \\frac{\\sum (\\bar{x}-x_{i})^2/N-1}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{N}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n### Example 1: Preposition Use across Real-Time{-}\n\nWe will now turn to our first example. In this example, we will investigate whether the frequency of prepositions has changed from Middle English to Late Modern English. The reasoning behind this example is that Old English was highly synthetic compared with Present-Day English which comparatively analytic. In other words, while Old English speakers used case to indicate syntactic relations, speakers of Present-Day English use word order and prepositions to indicate syntactic relationships. This means that the loss of case had to be compensated by different strategies and maybe these strategies continued to develop and increase in frequency even after the change from synthetic to analytic had been mostly accomplished. And this prolonged change in compensatory strategies is what this example will focus on. \n\nThe analysis is based on data extracted from the *Penn Corpora of Historical English* (see http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/), that consists of 603 texts written between 1125 and 1900. In preparation of this example, all elements that were part-of-speech tagged as prepositions were extracted from the PennCorpora. \n\nThen, the relative frequencies (per 1,000 words) of prepositions per text were calculated. This frequency of prepositions per 1,000 words represents our dependent variable. In a next step, the date when each letter had been written was extracted. The resulting two vectors were combined into a table which thus contained for each text, when it was written (independent variable) and its relative frequency of prepositions (dependent or outcome variable).\n\nA regression analysis will follow the steps described below: \n\n1. Extraction and processing of the data\n\n2. Data visualization\n\n3. Applying the regression analysis to the data\n\n4. Diagnosing the regression model and checking whether or not basic model assumptions have been violated.\n\nIn a first step, we load functions that we may need (which in this case is a function that we will use to summarize the results of the analysis).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load functions\nsource(\"https://slcladal.github.io/rscripts/slrsummary.r\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter

This can be useful when dealing with numeric variables because if we did not center year, we would get estimated values for year 0 (a year when English did not even exist yet). If a variable is centered, the regression provides estimates of the model refer to the mean of that numeric variable. In other words, centering can be very helpful, especially with respect to the interpretation of the results that regression models report.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# center date\nslrdata$Date <- slrdata$Date - mean(slrdata$Date) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will now begin the regression analysis by generating a first regression model and inspect its results. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create initial model\nm1.lm <- lm(Prepositions ~ Date, data = slrdata)\n# inspect results\nsummary(m1.lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Prepositions ~ Date, data = slrdata)\n\nResiduals:\n        Min          1Q      Median          3Q         Max \n-69.1012471 -13.8549421   0.5779091  13.3208913  62.8580401 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate      Std.

Then, the model provides the distribution of the residuals. The residuals should be distributed normally with the absolute values of the Min and Max as well as the 1Q (first quartile) and 3Q (third quartile) being similar or ideally identical. In our case, the values are very similar which suggests that the residuals are distributed evenly and follow a normal distribution. The next part of the report is the coefficients table. The estimate for the intercept is the value of y at x = 0. The estimate for Date represents the slope of the regression line and tells us that with each year, the predicted frequency of prepositions increase by .01732 prepositions. The t-value is the Estimate divided by the standard error (Std. Error). Based on the t-value, the p-value can be calculated manually as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# use pt function (which uses t-values and the degrees of freedom)\n2*pt(-2.383, nrow(slrdata)-1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.0175196401501\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe R^2^-values tell us how much variance is explained by our model. The baseline value represents a model that uses merely the mean. 0.0105 means that our model explains only 1.05 percent of the variance (0.010 x 100) - which is a tiny amount. The problem of the multiple R^2^ is that it will increase even if we add variables that explain almost no variance. Hence, multiple R^2^ encourages the inclusion of *junk* variables.\n\n\\begin{equation}\nR^2 = R^2_{multiple} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2}{\\sum (y_i - \\bar y)^2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe adjusted R^2^-value takes the number of predictors into account and, thus, the adjusted R^2^ will always be lower than the multiple R^2^. This is so because the adjusted R^2^ penalizes models for having predictors. The equation for the adjusted R^2^ below shows that the amount of variance that is explained by all the variables in the model (the top part of the fraction) must outweigh the inclusion of the number of variables (k) (lower part of the fraction). Thus, the  adjusted R^2^ will decrease when variables are added that explain little or even no variance while it will increase if variables are added that explain a lot of variance.\n\n\\begin{equation}\nR^2_{adjusted} = 1 - (\\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1})\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf there is a big difference between the two R^2^-values, then the model contains (many) predictors that do not explain much variance which is not good. The F-statistic and the associated p-value tell us that the model, despite explaining almost no variance, is still significantly better than an intercept-only base-line model (or using the overall mean to predict the frequency of prepositions per text).\n\nWe can test this and also see where the F-values comes from by comparing the \n \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create intercept-only base-line model\nm0.lm <- lm(Prepositions ~ 1, data = slrdata)\n# compare the base-line and the more saturated model\nanova(m1.lm, m0.lm, test = \"F\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: Prepositions ~ Date\nModel 2: Prepositions ~ 1\n  Res.Df         RSS Df   Sum of Sq       F   Pr(>F)  \n1    535 202058.2576                                  \n2    536 204203.8289 -1 -2145.57126 5.68094 0.017498 *\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe F- and p-values are exactly those reported by the summary which shows where the F-values comes from and what it means; namely it denote the difference between the base-line and the more saturated model.\n\n\nThe degrees of freedom associated with the residual standard error are the number of cases in the model minus the number of predictors (including the intercept).

The problem with this plot is that the residuals are not standardized and so they cannot be compared to the residuals of other models. To remedy this deficiency, residuals are normalized by dividing the residuals by their standard deviation. Then, the normalized residuals can be plotted against the observed values (center panel). In this way, not only are standardized residuals obtained, but the values of the residuals are transformed into z-values, and one can use the z-distribution to find problematic data points. There are three rules of thumb regarding finding problematic data points through standardized residuals [@field2012discovering 268-269]:\n\n* Points with values higher than 3.29 should be removed from the data.\n\n* If more than 1% of the data points have values higher than 2.58, then the error rate of our model is too high.\n\n* If more than 5% of the data points have values greater than 1.96, then the error rate of our model is too high.\n\n\nThe right panel shows the * studentized residuals* (adjusted predicted values: each data point is divided by the standard error of the residuals). In this way, it is possible to use Student's t-distribution to diagnose our model.\n\nAdjusted predicted values are residuals of a special kind: the model is calculated without a data point and then used to predict this data point. The difference between the observed data point and its predicted value is then called the adjusted predicted value. In summary, studentized residuals are very useful because they allow us to identify influential data points.\n\nThe plots show that there are two potentially problematic data points (the top-most and bottom-most point). These two points are clearly different from the other data points and may therefore be outliers. We will test later if these points need to be removed.\n\nWe will now generate more diagnostic plots.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate plots\nautoplot(m1.lm) + \n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/slr13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic plots are very positive and we will go through why this is so for each panel. The graph in the upper left panel is useful for finding outliers or for determining the correlation between residuals and predicted values: when a trend becomes visible in the line or points (e.g., a rising trend or a zigzag line), then this would indicate that the model would be problematic (in such cases, it can help to remove data points that are too influential (outliers)).\n\nThe graphic in the upper right panel indicates whether the residuals are normally distributed (which is desirable) or whether the residuals do not follow a normal distribution. If the points lie on the line, the residuals follow a normal distribution. For example, if the points are not on the line at the top and bottom, it shows that the model does not predict small and large values well and that it therefore does not have a good fit.\n\nThe graphic in the lower left panel provides information about *homoscedasticity*. Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals remains constant and does not correlate with any independent variable. In unproblematic cases, the graphic shows a flat line. If there is a trend in the line, we are dealing with heteroscedasticity, that is, a correlation between independent variables and the residuals, which is very problematic for regressions.\n\nThe graph in the lower right panel shows problematic influential data points that disproportionately affect the regression (this would be problematic). If such influential data points are present, they should be either weighted (one could generate a robust rather than a simple linear regression) or they must be removed. The graph displays Cook's distance, which shows how the regression changes when a model without this data point is calculated. The cook distance thus shows the influence a data point has on the regression as a whole. Data points that have a Cook's distance value greater than 1 are problematic [@field2012discovering 269].\n\nThe so-called leverage is also a measure that indicates how strongly a data point affects the accuracy of the regression. Leverage values range between 0 (no influence) and 1 (strong influence: suboptimal!). To test whether a specific data point has a high leverage value, we calculate a cut-off point that indicates whether the leverage is too strong or still acceptable. The following two formulas are used for this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nLeverage = \\frac{3(k + 1)}{n} |  \\frac{2(k + 1)}{n}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe will look more closely at leverage in the context of multiple linear regression and will therefore end the current analysis by summarizing the results of the regression analysis in a table.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create summary

significance, as well as the magnitude of the effects.\n\nIn addition, the results of simple linear regressions should be summarized in writing. \n\nWe can use the `reports` package [@report] to summarize the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreport::report(m1.lm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nWe fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict Prepositions with\nDate (formula: Prepositions ~ Date). The model explains a statistically\nsignificant and very weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.01, F(1, 535) = 5.68,\np = 0.017, adj. R2 = 8.66e-03). The model's intercept, corresponding to Date =\n0, is at 132.19 (95% CI [130.54, 133.84], t(535) = 157.62, p < .001). Within\nthis model:\n\n  - The effect of Date is statistically significant and positive (beta = 0.02,\n95% CI [3.05e-03, 0.03], t(535) = 2.38, p = 0.017; Std. beta = 0.10, 95% CI\n[0.02, 0.19])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized\nversion of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were\ncomputed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this output to write up a final report: \n\nA simple linear regression has been fitted to the data. A visual assessment of the model diagnostic graphics did not indicate any problematic or disproportionately influential data points (outliers) and performed significantly better compared to an intercept-only base line model but only explained .87 percent of the variance (adjusted R^2^: .0087, F-statistic (1, 535): 5,68, p-value: 0.0175\\*). The final minimal adequate linear regression model is based on 537 data points and confirms a significant and positive correlation between the year in which the text was written and the relative frequency of prepositions (coefficient estimate: .02 (standardized \\beta: 0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.19]), SE: 0.01, t-value~535~: 2.38, p-value: .0175\\*). Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using the Wald approximation.\n\n### Example 2: Teaching Styles{-}\n\nIn the previous example, we dealt with two numeric variables, while the following example deals with a categorical independent variable and a numeric dependent variable. The ability for regressions to handle very different types of variables makes regressions a widely used and robust method of analysis.\n\nIn this example, we are dealing with two groups of students that have been randomly assigned to be exposed to different teaching methods. Both groups undergo a language learning test after the lesson with a maximum score of 20 points. \n\nThe question that we will try to answer is whether the students in group A have performed significantly better than those in group B which would indicate that the teaching method to which group A was exposed works better than the teaching method to which group B was exposed.\n\nLet's move on to implementing the regression in R. In a first step, we load the data set and inspect its structure.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data\nslrdata2  <- base::readRDS(url(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/sgd.rda\",

The model explains a statistically significant and\nmoderate proportion of variance (R2 = 0.23, F(1, 58) = 17.55, p < .001, adj. R2\n= 0.22). The model's intercept, corresponding to Group = A, is at 14.93 (95% CI\n[13.86, 16.00], t(58) = 27.94, p < .001). Within this model:\n\n  - The effect of Group [B] is statistically significant and negative (beta =\n-3.17, 95% CI [-4.68, -1.65], t(58) = -4.19, p < .001; Std. beta = -0.96, 95%\nCI [-1.41, -0.50])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized\nversion of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were\ncomputed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this output to write up a final report: \n \n\nA simple linear regression was fitted to the data. A visual assessment of the model diagnostics did not indicate any problematic or disproportionately influential data points (outliers). The final linear regression model is based on 60 data points, performed significantly better than an intercept-only base line model (F (1, 58): 17.55, p-value <. 001^$***$^), and reported that the model explained 21.9 percent of variance which confirmed a good model fit. According to this final model, group A scored significantly better on the language learning test than group B (coefficient: -3.17, 95% CI [-4.68, -1.65], Std. \\beta: -0.96, 95% CI [-1.41, -0.50], SE: 0.48, t-value~58~: -4.19, p-value <. 001^$***$^). Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using the Wald approximation.\n\n\n## Multiple Linear Regression{-}\n\nIn contrast to simple linear regression, which estimates the effect of a single predictor, multiple linear regression estimates the effect of various predictor (see the equation below). A multiple linear regression can thus test the effects of various predictors simultaneously.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}x_{i} + \\beta_{2}x_{i+1} + \\dots + \\beta_{n}x_{i+n} + \\epsilon\n\n\\end{equation}\n\nThere exists a wealth of literature focusing on multiple linear regressions and the concepts it is based on.  For instance, there are @achen1982interpreting, @bortz2006statistik, @crawley2005statistics, @faraway2002practical, @field2012discovering, @gries2021statistics, @levshina2015linguistics, @winter2019statistics and @wilcox2009basic to name just a few. Introductions to regression modeling in R are @baayen2008analyzing, @crawley2012r, @gries2021statistics, or @levshina2015linguistics.\n\nThe model diagnostics we are dealing with here are partly identical to the diagnostic methods discussed in the section on simple linear regression. Because of this overlap, diagnostics will only be described in more detail if they have not been described in the section on simple linear regression.\n\n***\n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\n<b>EXCURSION</b></p>\n<p style='margin-left:1em;'>\n</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"question\">` \n\n<details>\n  <summary>A note on sample size and power</summary>\n  A brief note on minimum necessary sample or data set size appears necessary here. Although there appears to be a general assumption that 25 data points per group are sufficient, this is not necessarily correct (it is merely a general rule of thumb that is actually often incorrect). Such rules of thumb are inadequate because the required sample size depends on the number of variables in a given model, the size of the effect and the variance of the effect - in other words, the minimum necessary sample size relates to *statistical power* (see [here](https://slcladal.github.io/pwr.html) for a tutorial on power). If a model contains many variables, then this requires a larger sample size than a model which only uses very few predictors. \n\n  Also, to detect an effect with a very minor effect size, one needs a substantially larger sample compared to cases where the effect is very strong. In fact, when dealing with small effects, model require a minimum of 600 cases to reliably detect these effects. Finally, effects that are very robust and do not vary much require a much smaller sample size compared with effects that are spurious and vary substantially. Since the sample size depends on the effect size and variance as well as the number of variables, there is no final one-size-fits-all answer to what the best sample size is.\n  \n  Another, slightly better but still incorrect, rule of thumb is that the more data, the better. This is not correct because models based on too many cases are prone for overfitting and thus report correlations as being significant that are not. However, given that there are procedures that can correct for overfitting, larger data sets are still preferable to data sets that are simply too small to warrant reliable results. In conclusion, it remains true that the sample size depends on the effect under investigation.\n</details>\n\n</div>`\n\n***\n\nDespite there being no ultimate rule of thumb, @field2012discovering[273-275], based on @green1991many, provide data-driven suggestions for the minimal size of data required for regression models that aim to find medium sized effects (k = number of predictors; categorical variables with more than two levels should be transformed into dummy variables):\n\n* If one is merely interested in the overall model fit (something I have not encountered), then the sample size should be at least 50 + k (k = number of predictors in model).\n\n*  If one is only interested in the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).\n\n*  If one is only interested in both model fit and the effect of specific variables, then the sample size should be at least the higher value of 50 + k or 104 + k (k = number of predictors in model).\n\nYou will see in the R code below that there is already a function that tests whether the sample size is sufficient.\n\n### Example: Gifts and Availability{-}\n\nThe example we will go through here is taken from @field2012discovering. In this example, the research question is if the money that men spend on presents for women depends on the women's attractiveness and their relationship status. To answer this research question, we will implement a multiple linear regression and start by loading the data and inspect its structure and properties.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#

The first column contains the relationship status of the present giver (in this study this were men), the second whether the man is interested in the woman (the present receiver in this study), and the third column represents the money spend on the present. The data set represents 100 cases and the mean amount of money spend on a present is 88.38 dollars. In a next step, we visualize the data to get a more detailed impression of the relationships between variables.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create plots\np1 <- ggplot(mlrdata, aes(status, money)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  theme_bw()\n# plot 2\np2 <- ggplot(mlrdata, aes(attraction, money)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_bw()\n# plot 3\np3 <- ggplot(mlrdata, aes(x = money)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) +            \n  theme_bw() +         \n  geom_density(alpha=.2, fill = \"gray50\") \n# plot 4\np4 <- ggplot(mlrdata, aes(status, money)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(status))) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"grey30\", \"grey70\")) + \n  facet_wrap(~ attraction) + \n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  theme_bw()\n# show plots\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs = list(p1, p2, p3, p4), widths = c(1, 1), layout_matrix = rbind(c(1, 2), c(3, 4)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/mlr3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe upper left figure consists of a boxplot which shows how much money was spent by relationship status. The figure suggests that men spend more on women if they are not in a relationship. The next figure shows the relationship between the money spend on presents and whether or not the men were interested in the women.\n\nThe boxplot in the upper right panel suggests that men spend substantially more on women if the men are interested in them. The next figure depicts the distribution of the amounts of money spend on the presents for the women. In addition, the figure indicates the existence of two outliers (dots in the boxplot)\n\nThe histogram in the lower left panel shows that, although the mean amount of money spent on presents is 88.38 dollars, the distribution peaks around 50 dollars indicating that on average, men spend about 50 dollars on presents. Finally, we will plot the amount of money spend on presents against relationship status by attraction in order to check whether the money spent on presents is affected by an interaction between attraction and relationship status.\n\nThe boxplot in the lower right panel confirms the existence of an interaction (a non-additive term) as men only spend more money on  women if the men single *and* they are interested in the women. If men are not interested in the women, then the relationship has no effect as they spend an equal amount of money on the women regardless of whether they are in a relationship or not.\n\nWe will now start to implement the regression model. In a first step, we create two saturated models that contain all possible predictors (main effects and interactions). The two models are identical but one is generated with the `lm` and the other with the `glm` function as these functions offer different model parameters in their output.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1.mlr = lm(                      # generate lm regression object\n  money ~ 1 + attraction*status,  # def. regression formula (1 = intercept)\n  data = mlrdata)                 # def. data\nm1.glm = glm(                     # generate glm regression object\n  money ~ 1 + attraction*status,  # def. regression formula (1 = intercept)\n  family = gaussian,              # def. linkage function\n  data = mlrdata)                 # def. data\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter generating the saturated models we can now start with the model fitting. Model fitting refers to a process that aims at find the model that explains a maximum of variance with a minimum of predictors [see @field2012discovering 318]. Model fitting is therefore based on the *principle of parsimony* which is related to Occam's razor according to which explanations that require fewer assumptions are more likely to be true.\n\n### Automatic Model Fitting and Why You Should Not Use It{-}\n\nIn this section, we will use a step-wise step-down procedure that uses decreases in AIC (*Akaike Information Criterion*) as the criterion to minimize the model in a step-wise manner. This procedure aims at finding the model with the lowest AIC values by evaluating - step-by-step - whether the removal of a predictor (term) leads to a lower AIC value.\n\nWe use this method here just so that you know it exists and how to implement it but you should rather avoid using automated model fitting. The reason for avoiding automated model fitting is that the algorithm only checks if the AIC has decreased but not if the model is stable or reliable. Thus, automated model fitting has the problem that you can never be sure that the way that lead you to the final model is reliable and that all models were indeed stable. Imagine you want to climb down from a roof top and you have a ladder. The problem is that you do not know if and how many steps are broken. This is similar to using automated model fitting. In other sections, we will explore better methods to fit models (manual step-wise step-up and step-down procedures, for example).\n\nThe AIC is calculated using the equation below. The lower the AIC value, the better the balance between explained variance and the number of predictors. AIC values can and should only be compared for models that are fit on the same data set with the same (number of) cases (*LL* stands for *logged likelihood* or *LogLikelihood* and *k* represents the number of predictors in the model (including the intercept); the LL represents a measure of how good the model fits the data).\n\n\\begin{equation}\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) = -2LL + 2k\n\\end{equation}\n\nAn alternative to the AIC is the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Both AIC and BIC penalize models for including variables in a model. The penalty of the BIC is bigger than the penalty of the AIC and it includes the number of cases in the model (*LL* stands for *logged likelihood* or *LogLikelihood*, *k* represents the number of predictors in the model (including the intercept), and *N* represents the number of cases in the model). \n\n\\begin{equation}\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) = -2LL + 2k * log(N)\n\\end{equation}\n\nInteractions are evaluated first and only if all insignificant interactions have been removed would the procedure start removing insignificant main effects (that are not part of significant interactions). Other model fitting procedures (forced entry, step-wise step up, hierarchical) are discussed during the implementation of other regression models. We cannot discuss all procedures here as model fitting is rather complex and a discussion of even the most common procedures would to lengthy and time consuming at this point. It is important to note though that there is not perfect model fitting procedure and automated approaches should be handled with care as they are likely to ignore violations of model parameters that can be detected during manual - but time consuming - model fitting procedures. As a general rule of thumb, it is advisable to fit models as carefully and deliberately as possible. We will now begin to fit the model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# automated AIC based model fitting\nstep(m1.mlr, direction = \"both\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nStart:  AIC=592.52\nmoney ~ 1 + attraction * status\n\n                    Df   Sum of Sq         RSS         AIC\n<none>                             34557.56428 592.5211556\n- attraction:status  1 24947.25481 59504.81909 644.8642395\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = money ~ 1 + attraction * status, data = mlrdata)\n\nCoefficients:\n                         (Intercept)               attractionNotInterested  \n                             99.1548                              -47.6628  \n                        statusSingle  attractionNotInterested:statusSingle  \n                             57.6928                              -63.1788  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe automated model fitting procedure informs us that removing predictors has not caused a decrease in the AIC.

Then, the report provides the residual distribution (the range, median and quartiles of the residuals) which allows drawing inferences about the distribution of differences between observed and expected values. If the residuals are distributed non-normally, then this is a strong indicator that the model is unstable and unreliable because mathematical assumptions on which the model is based are violated.\n\nNext, the model summary reports the most important part: a table with model statistics of the fixed-effects structure of the model. The table contains the estimates (coefficients of the predictors), standard errors, t-values, and the p-values which show whether a predictor significantly correlates with the dependent variable that the model investigates.\n\nAll main effects (status and attraction) as well as the interaction between status and attraction is reported as being significantly correlated with the dependent variable (money). An interaction occurs if a correlation between the dependent variable and a predictor is affected by another predictor.\n\nThe top most term is called intercept and has a value of 99.15 which represents the base estimate to which all other estimates refer. To exemplify what this means, let us consider what the model would predict that a man would spend on a present if he interested in the woman but he is also in a relationship. The amount he would spend (based on the model would be 99.15 dollars (which is the intercept). This means that the intercept represents the predicted value if all predictors take the base or reference level. And since being in relationship but being interested are the case, and because the interaction does not apply, the predicted value in our example is exactly the intercept (see below). \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#intercept  Single  NotInterested  Single:NotInterested\n99.15     + 57.69  + 0           + 0     # 156.8 single + interested\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 156.84\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n99.15     + 57.69  - 47.66       - 63.18 # 46.00 single + not interested\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 46\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n99.15     - 0      + 0           - 0     # 99.15 relationship + interested\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 99.15\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n99.15     - 0      - 47.66       - 0     # 51.49 relationship + not interested\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 51.49\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, let us consider what a man would spend if he is in a relationship and he is not attracted to the women. In that case, the model predicts that the man would spend only  51.49 dollars on a present: the intercept (99.15) minus 47.66 because the man is not interested (and no additional subtraction because the interaction does not apply). \n\nWe can derive the same results easier using the `predict` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# make prediction based on the model for original data\nprediction <- predict(m2.mlr, newdata = mlrdata)\n# inspect predictions\ntable(round(prediction,2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n 46.01  51.49  99.15 156.85 \n    25     25     25     25 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBelow the table of coefficients, the regression summary reports model statistics that provide information about how well the model performs. The difference between the values and the values in the coefficients table is that the model statistics refer to the model as a whole rather than focusing on individual predictors.\n\nThe multiple R^2^-value is a measure of how much variance the model explains. A multiple R^2^-value of 0 would inform us that the model does not explain any variance while a value of .852 mean that the model explains 85.2 percent of the variance. A value of 1 would inform us that the model explains 100 percent of the variance and that the predictions of the model match the observed values perfectly. Multiplying the multiple R^2^-value thus provides the percentage of explained variance. Models that have a multiple R^2^-value equal or higher than .05 are deemed substantially significant [see @szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 55]. It has been claimed that models should explain a minimum of 5 percent of variance but this is problematic as it is not uncommon for models to have very low explanatory power while still performing significantly and systematically better than chance. In addition, the total amount of variance is negligible in cases where one is interested in very weak but significant effects. It is much more important for model to perform significantly better than minimal base-line models because if this is not the case, then the model does not have any predictive and therefore no explanatory power.\n\nThe adjusted R^2^-value considers the amount of explained variance in light of the number of predictors in the model (it is thus somewhat similar to the AIC and BIC) and informs about how well the model would perform if it were applied to the population that the sample is drawn from. Ideally, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value should be very small as this means that the model is not overfitted. If, however, the difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value is substantial, then this would strongly suggest that the model is unstable and overfitted to the data while being inadequate for drawing inferences about the population. Differences between multiple and adjusted R^2^-values indicate that the data contains outliers that cause the distribution of the data on which the model is based to differ from the distributions that the model mathematically requires to provide reliable estimates. The difference between multiple and adjusted R^2^-value in our model is very small (85.2-84.7=.05) and should not cause concern.\n\nBefore continuing, we will calculate the confidence intervals of the coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract confidence intervals of the coefficients\nconfint(m2.mlr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                                              2.5 %         97.5 %\n(Intercept)                           91.6225795890 106.6870204110\nstatusSingle                          47.0406317400  68.3449682600\nattractionNotInterested              -58.3149682600 -37.0106317400\nstatusSingle:attractionNotInterested -78.2432408219 -48.1143591781\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create and compare baseline- and minimal adequate model\nm0.mlr <- lm(money ~1, data = mlrdata)\nanova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: money ~ 1\nModel 2: money ~ (status + attraction)^2\n  Res.Df          RSS Df   Sum of Sq         F                 Pr(>F)    \n1     99 233562.28650                                                    \n2     96  34557.56428  3 199004.7222 184.27662 < 0.000000000000000222 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, we compare the final minimal adequate model to the base-line model to test whether then final model significantly outperforms the baseline model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compare baseline- and minimal adequate model\nAnova(m0.mlr, m2.mlr, type = \"III\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnova Table (Type III tests)\n\nResponse: money\n                 Sum Sq Df    F value                 Pr(>F)    \n(Intercept) 781015.8300  1 2169.64133 < 0.000000000000000222 ***\nResiduals    34557.5643 96                                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison between the two model confirms that the minimal adequate model performs significantly better (makes significantly more accurate estimates of the outcome variable) compared with the baseline model.\n\n\n\n### Model diagnostics {-}\n\nWe now check the model performance using the `model_performance()` function and to diagnose the model, we are using the `check_model()` function from the `performance` package [@ludeke2021performance]. \n\n\nWe start by checking the performance of the null-model against the performance values of the final minimal adequate model.

This means that independent variables cannot be correlated with itself (for instance, because data points come from the same subject). If there is autocorrelation among predictors, then a Repeated Measures Design or a (hierarchical) mixed-effects model should be implemented instead.\n\n7) Predictors cannot substantially correlate with each other (multicollinearity) (see the [subsection on (multi-)collinearity](https://slcladal.github.io/regression.html#Multicollinearity) in the section of multiple binomial logistic regression for more details about (multi-)collinearity). If a model contains predictors that have variance inflation factors (VIF) > 10 the model is unreliable [@myers1990classical] and predictors causing such VIFs should be removed.

Beta errors (or $\\beta$-errors) refer to the erroneous assumption that a predictor is not significant (based on the analysis and given the sample) although it does have an effect in the population. In other words, $\\beta$-error means to overlook a significant effect because of weaknesses of the analysis. The test statistics ranges between 0 and 1 where lower values are better. If the values approximate 1, then there is serious concern as the model is not reliable given the sample size.

The model explains a\nstatistically significant and substantial proportion of variance (R2 = 0.86,\nF(3, 94) = 188.36, p < .001, adj. R2 = 0.85). The model's intercept,\ncorresponding to status = Relationship and attraction = Interested, is at 99.15\n(95% CI [92.01, 106.30], t(94) = 27.56, p < .001). Within this model:\n\n  - The effect of status [Single] is statistically significant and positive (beta\n= 55.85, 95% CI [45.65, 66.06], t(94) = 10.87, p < .001; Std. beta = 1.19, 95%\nCI [0.97, 1.41])\n  - The effect of attraction [NotInterested] is statistically significant and\nnegative (beta = -47.66, 95% CI [-57.76, -37.56], t(94) = -9.37, p < .001; Std.\nbeta = -1.02, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.80])\n  - The effect of status [Single] × attraction [NotInterested] is statistically\nsignificant and negative (beta = -59.46, 95% CI [-73.89, -45.03], t(94) =\n-8.18, p < .001; Std. beta = -1.27, 95% CI [-1.58, -0.96])\n\nStandardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized\nversion of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were\ncomputed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this output to write up a final report: \n\n\nA multiple linear regression was fitted to the data using an automated, step-wise, AIC-based (Akaike's Information Criterion) procedure. The model fitting arrived at a final minimal model. During the model diagnostics, two outliers were detected and removed. Further diagnostics did not find other issues after the removal.\n\nThe final minimal adequate regression model is based on 98 data points and performs highly significantly better than a minimal baseline model (multiple R^2^: .857, adjusted R^2^: .853, F-statistic (3, 94): 154.4, AIC: 850.4, BIC: 863.32, p<.001^$***$^). The final minimal adequate regression model reports *attraction* and *status* as significant main effects. The relationship status of men correlates highly significantly and positively with the amount of money spend on the women's presents (SE: 5.14, t-value: 10.87, p<.001^$***$^). This shows that men spend 156.8 dollars on presents if they are single while they spend 99,15 dollars if they are in a relationship. Whether men are attracted to women also correlates highly significantly and positively with the money they spend on women (SE: 5.09, t-values: -9.37, p<.001^$***$^). If men are not interested in women, they spend 47.66 dollar less on a present for women compared with women the men are interested in.\n\nFurthermore, the final minimal adequate regression model reports a highly significant interaction between relationship *status* and *attraction* (SE: 7.27, t-value: -8.18, p<.001^$***$^): If men are single but they are not interested in a women, a man would spend only 59.46 dollars on a present compared to all other constellations.\n\n## Multiple Binomial Logistic Regression{-}\n\nLogistic regression is a multivariate analysis technique that builds on and is very similar in terms of its implementation to linear regression but logistic regressions take dependent variables that represent nominal rather than numeric scaling [@harrell2015regression]. The difference requires that the linear regression must be modified in certain ways to avoid producing non-sensical outcomes. The most fundamental difference between logistic and linear regressions is that logistic regression work on the probabilities of an outcome (the likelihood), rather than the outcome itself. In addition, the likelihoods on which the logistic regression works must be logged (logarithmized) in order to avoid produce predictions that produce values greater than 1 (instance occurs) and 0 (instance does not occur). You can check this by logging the values from -10 to 10 using the `plogis` function as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nround(plogis(-10:10), 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 0.00005 0.00012 0.00034 0.00091 0.00247 0.00669 0.01799 0.04743 0.11920\n[10] 0.26894 0.50000 0.73106 0.88080 0.95257 0.98201 0.99331 0.99753 0.99909\n[19] 0.99966 0.99988 0.99995\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf we visualize these logged values, we get an S-shaped curve which reflects the logistic function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blm0b-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand what this mean, we will use a very simple example. In this example, we want to see whether the height of men affect their likelihood of being in a relationship. The data we use represents a data set consisting of two variables: height and relationship.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blm1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe left panel of the Figure above shows that a linear model would predict values for the relationship status, which represents a factor (0 = Single and 1 = In a Relationship), that are nonsensical because values above 1 or below 0 do not make sense. In contrast to a linear regression, which predicts actual values, such as the frequencies of prepositions in a certain text, a logistic regression predicts *probabilities* of events (for example, being in a relationship) rather than actual values. The center panel shows the predictions of a logistic regression and we see that a logistic regression also has an intercept and a (very steep) slope but that the regression line also predicts values that are above 1 and below 0. However, when we log the predicted values we these predicted values are transformed into probabilities with values between 0 and 1. And the logged regression line has a S-shape which reflects the logistic function. Furthermore, we can then find the optimal line (the line with the lowest residual deviance) by comparing the sum of residuals - just as we did for a simple linear model and that way, we find the regression line for a logistic regression. \n\n### Example 1: EH in Kiwi English{-}\n\nTo exemplify how to implement a logistic regression in R [see @agresti1996introduction; @agresti2011categorical] for very good and thorough introductions to this topic], we will analyze the use of the discourse particle *eh* in New Zealand English and test which factors correlate with its occurrence. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender, ethnicity, and age of that speaker and whether or not the speech unit contained an *eh*. To begin with, we clean the current work space, set option, install and activate relevant packages, load customized functions, and load the example data set.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

The variable `ID` contains strings that represent a combination file and speaker of a speech unit. The second variable represents the gender, the third the age, and the fourth the ethnicity of speakers. The fifth variable represents whether or not a speech unit contained the discourse particle *eh*. \n\nNext, we factorize the variables in our data set. In other words, we specify that the strings represent variable levels and define new reference levels because as a default `R` will use the variable level which first occurs in alphabet ordering as the reference level for each variable, we redefine the variable levels for Age and Ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblrdata <- blrdata %>%\n  # factorize variables\n  dplyr::mutate(Age = factor(Age),\n                Gender = factor(Gender),\n                Ethnicity = factor(Ethnicity),\n                ID = factor(ID),\n                EH = factor(EH)) %>%\n  # relevel Age (Reference = Young) and Ethnicity (Reference= Pakeha))\n  dplyr::mutate(Age = relevel(Age, \"Young\"),\n                Ethnicity = relevel(Ethnicity, \"Pakeha\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter preparing the data, we will now plot the data to get an overview of potential relationships between variables.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nblrdata %>%\n  dplyr::mutate(EH = ifelse(EH == \"0\", 0, 1)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Age, EH, color = Gender)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Ethnicity) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\") +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2) +\n  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 10)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Observed Probabilty of eh\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray20\", \"gray70\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blm6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to main effects, the Figure above indicates that men use *eh* more frequently than women, that young speakers use it more frequently compared with old speakers, and that speakers that are descendants of European settlers (Pakeha) use *eh* more frequently compared with Maori (the native inhabitants of New Zealand).\n\nThe plots in the lower panels do not indicate significant interactions between use of *eh* and the Age, Gender, and Ethnicity of speakers. In a next step, we will start building the logistic regression model.\n\n### Model Building{-}\n\nAs a first step, we need to define contrasts and use the `datadist` function to store aspects of our variables that can be accessed later when plotting and summarizing the model. Contrasts define what and how variable levels should be compared and therefore influences how the results of the regression analysis are presented. In this case, we use treatment contrasts which are in-built. Treatment contrasts mean that we assess the significance of levels of a predictor against a baseline which is the reference level of a predictor. @field2012discovering [414-427] and @gries2021statistics provide very good and accessible explanations of contrasts and how to manually define contrasts if you would like to know more. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set contrasts\noptions(contrasts  =c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))\n# extract distribution summaries for all potential variables\nblrdata.dist <- datadist(blrdata)\n# store distribution summaries for all potential variables\noptions(datadist = \"blrdata.dist\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNext, we generate a minimal model that predicts the use of *eh* solely based on the intercept.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# baseline glm model\nm0.blr = glm(EH ~ 1, family = binomial, data = blrdata)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Model fitting{-}\n\nWe will now start with the model fitting procedure. In the present case, we will use a manual step-wise step-up procedure during which predictors are added to the model if they significantly improve the model fit. In addition, we will perform diagnostics as we fit the model at each step of the model fitting process rather than after the fitting.\n\nWe will test two things in particular: whether the data has incomplete information or complete separation and if the model suffers from (multi-)collinearity. \n\nIncomplete information or complete separation means that the data does not contain all combinations of the predictor or the dependent variable. This is important because if the data does not contain cases of all combinations, the model will assume that it has found a perfect predictor. In such cases the model overestimates the effect of that that predictor and the results of that model are no longer reliable. For example, if *eh* was only used by young speakers in the data, the model would jump on that fact and say *Ha! If there is an old speaker, that means that that speaker will never ever and under no circumstances say *eh* - I can therefore ignore all other factors!* \n\nMulticollinearity means that predictors correlate and have shared variance. This means that whichever predictor is included first will take all the variance that it can explain and the remaining part of the variable that is shared will not be attributed to the other predictor. This may lead to reporting that a factor is not significant because all of the variance it can explain is already accounted for. However, if the other predictor were included first, then the original predictor would be returned as insignificant. This means that- depending on the order in which predictors are added - the results of the regression can differ dramatically and the model is therefore not reliable. Multicollinearity is actually a very common problem and there are various ways to deal with it but it cannot be ignored (at least in regression analyses).\n\nWe will start by adding *Age* to the minimal adequate model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# check incomplete information\nifelse(min(ftable(blrdata$Age, blrdata$EH)) == 0, \"not possible\", \"possible\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"possible\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add age to the model\nm1.blr = glm(EH ~ Age, family = binomial, data = blrdata)\n# check multicollinearity (vifs should have values of 3 or lower for main effects)\nifelse(max(vif(m1.blr)) <= 3,  \"vifs ok\", \"WARNING: high vifs!\") # VIFs ok\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"vifs ok\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# check if adding Age significantly improves model fit\nanova(m1.blr, m0.blr, test = \"Chi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\nModel 1: EH ~ Age\nModel 2: EH ~ 1\n  Resid.

The output of the `validate` function shows how often predictors are retained if the sample is re-selected with the same size but with placing back drawn data points. The execution of the function requires some patience as it is rather computationally expensive and it is, therefore, commented out below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# model validation (remove # to activate: output too long for website)\nm7.lrm <- lrm(EH ~ (Age+Gender+Ethnicity)^3, data = blrdata, x = T, y = T, linear.predictors = T)\n#validate(m7.lrm, bw = T, B = 200)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `validate` function shows that retaining two predictors (Age and Gender) is the best option and thereby confirms our final minimal adequate model as the best minimal model. In addition, we check whether we need to include a penalty for data points because they have too strong of an impact of the model fit. To see whether a penalty is warranted, we apply the `pentrace` function to the final minimal adequate model.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npentrace(m2.lrm, seq(0, 0.8, by = 0.05)) # determine penalty\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nBest penalty:\n\n penalty            df\n     0.8 1.99925395138\n\n penalty            df           aic           bic         aic.c\n    0.00 2.00000000000 864.213801108 847.895914321 864.213336316\n    0.05 1.99995335085 864.213893816 847.896387637 864.213429042\n    0.10 1.99990670452 864.213985335 847.896859740 864.213520579\n    0.15 1.99986006100 864.214075641 847.897330609 864.213610904\n    0.20 1.99981342030 864.214164764 847.897800270 864.213700044\n    0.25 1.99976678241 864.214252710 847.898268733 864.213788009\n    0.30 1.99972014734 864.214339446 847.898735961 864.213874762\n    0.35 1.99967351509 864.214424993 847.899201978 864.213960327\n    0.40 1.99962688564 864.214509360 847.899666792 864.214044712\n    0.45 1.99958025902 864.214592526 847.900130382 864.214127896\n    0.50 1.99953363520 864.214674504 847.900592761 864.214209892\n    0.55 1.99948701420 864.214755279 847.901053914 864.214290685\n    0.60 1.99944039601 864.214834874 847.901513865 864.214370299\n    0.65 1.99939378063 864.214913276 847.901972599 864.214448719\n    0.70 1.99934716807 864.214990480 847.902430112 864.214525941\n    0.75 1.99930055832 864.215066506 847.902886425 864.214601985\n    0.80 1.99925395138 864.215141352 847.903341534 864.214676849\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe values are so similar  that a penalty is unnecessary.

In a first step, we test for the existence of multicollinearity.\n\n### Multicollinearity{-}\n\nMulticollinearity means that predictors in a model can be predicted by other predictors in the model (this means that they *share* variance with other predictors). If this is the case, the model results are unreliable because the presence of absence of one predictor has substantive effects on at least one other predictor. \n\nTo check whether the final minimal model contains predictors that correlate with each other, we extract variance inflation factors (VIF). If a model contains predictors that have variance inflation factors (VIF) > 10 the model is unreliable [@myers1990classical]. @gries2021statistics shows that a VIF of 10 means that that predictor is explainable (predictable) from the other predictors in the model with an R^2^ of .9 (a VIF of 5 means that predictor is explainable (predictable) from the other predictors in the model with an R^2^ of .8).Indeed, predictors with VIF values greater than 4 are usually already problematic but, for large data sets, even VIFs greater than 2 can lead inflated standard errors ([Jaeger 2013](http://wiki.bcs.rochester.edu/HlpLab/LSA2013Regression?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=LSA13-Lecture6-CommonIssuesAndSolutions.pdf)). Also, VIFs of 2.5 can be problematic [@szmrecsanyi2006morphosyntactic 215] and [@zuur2010protocol] proposes that variables with VIFs exceeding 3 should be removed.\n\n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\n<b>NOTE</b><br><br>However, (multi-)collinearity is only an issue if one is interested in interpreting regression results!

Lemeshow)**\n\nHosmer and Lemeshow's R^2^ \"is the proportional reduction in the absolute value of the log-likelihood  measure and as such it is a measure of how much the badness of fit improves  as a result of the inclusion of the predictor variables. It can vary between 0 (indicating that the predictors are useless at predicting the outcome variable) and 1 (indicating that the model predicts the outcome variable perfectly)\" [@field2012discovering 317].\n\n**R^2^ (Cox & Snell)**\n\n \"Cox and Snell's R^2^ (1989) is based on the deviance of the model (-2LL(new»)\n and the deviance of the baseline model (-2LL(baseline), and the sample size,\n n [...]. However, this statistic never reaches its theoretical maximum of 1.\n\n**R2 (Nagelkerke)**\n\n Since R^2^ (Cox & Snell) never reaches its theoretical maximum of 1,\n Nagelkerke (1991) suggested Nagelkerke's R^2^ [@field2012discovering 317-318].\n\n**Somers’ D~xy~**\n\n Somers’ D~xy~ is a rank correlation between predicted probabilities and observed\n responses ranges between 0 (randomness) and 1 (perfect prediction). Somers' D~xy~ should have a value higher than .5 for the model to be meaningful [@baayen2008analyzing 204].\n\n**C**\n\n C is an index of concordance between the predicted probability and the\n observed response. When C takes the value 0.5, the predictions are random,\n when it is 1, prediction is perfect. A value above 0.8 indicates that the\n model may have some real predictive capacity [@baayen2008analyzing 204].\n\n**Akaike information criteria (AIC)**\n\nAkaike information criteria (AlC = -2LL + 2k) provide a value that reflects a ratio between the number of predictors in the model and the variance that is explained by these predictors. Changes in AIC can serve as a measure of whether the inclusion of a variable leads to a significant increase in the amount of variance that is explained by the model. \"You can think of this as the price you pay for something: you get a better value of R^2^, but you pay a higher price, and was that higher price worth it?  These information criteria help you to decide. The BIC is the same as the AIC but adjusts the penalty included in the AlC (i.e., 2k) by the number of cases: BlC = -2LL + 2k x log(n) in which n is the number of cases in the model\" [@field2012discovering 318].\n\nWe can use the `reports` package [@report] to summarize the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreport::report(lr.glm)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nWe fitted a logistic model (estimated using ML) to predict EH with Age and\nGender (formula: EH ~ Age + Gender).

For this reason, ordinal regression is one of the key methods in analysing Likert data. \n\nTo see how an ordinal regression is implemented in R, we load and inspect the ´ordinaldata´ data set. The data set consists of 400 observations of students that were either educated at this school (Internal = 1) or not (Internal = 0). Some of the students have been abroad (Exchange = 1) while other have not (Exchange = 0). In addition, the data set contains the students' final score of a language test (FinalScore) and the dependent variable which the recommendation of a committee for an additional, very prestigious program. The recommendation has three levels (*very likely*, *somewhat likely*, and *unlikely*) and reflects the committees’ assessment of whether the student is likely to succeed in the program.\n\n\n\n\n:::

For instances the number of pauses in two-minute-long conversations. Poisson regressions are particularly appealing when dealing with rare events, i.e. when something only occurs very infrequently. In such cases, normal linear regressions do not work because the instances that do occur are automatically considered outliers. Therefore, it is useful to check if the data conform to a Poisson distribution.\n\nHowever, the tricky thing about Poisson regressions is that the data has to conform to the Poisson distribution which is, according to my experience, rarely the case, unfortunately. The Gaussian Normal Distribution is very flexible because it is defined by two parameters, the mean (mu, i.e. $\\mu$) and the standard deviation (sigma, i.e. $\\sigma$). This allows the normal distribution to take very different shapes (for example, very high and slim (compressed) or very wide and flat). In contrast, the Poisson is defined by only one parameter (lambda, i.e. $\\lambda$) which mean that if we have a mean of 2, then the standard deviation is also 2 (actually we would have to say that the mean is $\\lambda$ and the standard deviation is also  $\\lambda$ or $\\lambda$ = $\\mu$ = $\\sigma$). This is much trickier for natural data as this means that the Poisson distribution is very rigid.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/pr0-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, as $\\lambda$ takes on higher values, the distribution becomes wider and flatter - a compressed distribution with a high mean can therefore not be Poisson-distributed. We will now start by loading the data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data\npoissondata  <- base::readRDS(url(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/prd.rda\", \"rb\"))\n```\n:::\n\n:::

This means that the problematic data points should have lower weights than other data points (the maximum is 1 - so points can only be made \"lighter\"). \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhweights <- data.frame(status = robustdata$status, resid = rmodel$resid, weight = rmodel$rweights)\nhweights2 <- hweights[order(rmodel$rweights), ]\nhweights2[1:15, ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         status          resid         weight\n83       Single  62.4234280426 0.415507214894\n52       Single -61.1426979566 0.434323578289\n88       Single  55.2134280426 0.521220526760\n84       Single  55.1234280426 0.522529106622\n78       Single  50.1934280426 0.593234343069\n65       Single -49.9526979566 0.596626306571\n1  Relationship  49.6398161925 0.601024865582\n67       Single -48.7926979566 0.612874578464\n21 Relationship  45.2098161925 0.661914499988\n24 Relationship  44.8698161925 0.666467581490\n39 Relationship -43.8940578083 0.679427975993\n79       Single  40.8234280426 0.719104361372\n58       Single -40.5226979566 0.722893449575\n89       Single  39.9734280426 0.729766992775\n95       Single  39.8234280426 0.731633375015\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe values of the weights support our assumption that those data points that were deemed too influential are made *lighter* as they now only have weights of 0.415507214894 and 0.434323578289 respectively. This was, however, not the focus of this sections as this section merely served to introduce the concept of weights and how they can be used in the context of a robust linear regression.\n\n# Mixed-Effects Regression\n\nIn contrast to fixed-effects regression models, mixed-effects models assume a hierarchical data structure in which data points are grouped or nested in higher order categories (e.g. students within classes). Mixed-effects models are rapidly increasing in use in data analysis because they allow us to incorporate hierarchical or nested data structures. Mixed-effects models are, of course, an extension of fixed-effects regression models and also multivariate and come in different types. \n\nIn the following, we will go over the most relevant and frequently used types of mixed-effect regression models, mixed-effects linear regression models and mixed-effects binomial logistic regression models. \n\nThe major difference between these types of models is that they take different types of dependent variables. While linear models take numeric dependent variables, logistic models take nominal variables.\n\n\n## Linear Mixed-Effects Regression{-}\n\nThe following focuses on an extension of ordinary multiple linear regressions: mixed-effects regression linear regression. Mixed-effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests: \n\n* Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors. \n\n* Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical or nested data structures. This applies if several observations are produced by an individual speaker, for instance.\n\n* Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. (multi-)collinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.). \n\nMajor disadvantages of mixed-effects regression modeling are that they are prone to producing high $\\beta$-errors [see @johnson2009getting] and that they require rather large data sets. \n\n### Introduction{-}\n\nSo far, the regression models that we have used only had fixed-effects. Having only fixed-effects means that all data points are treated as if they are completely independent and thus on the same hierarchical level. However, it is very common that the data is nested in the sense that data points are not independent because they are, for instance produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristic. In such cases, the data is considered hierarchical and statistical models should incorporate such structural features of the data they work upon. Fortunately, modeling hierarchical or nested data structures is very easy thanks to the `lme4` package [@lme4].\n\n\nWith respect to regression modeling, hierarchical structures are incorporated by what is called *random effects*. When models only have a fixed-effects structure, then they make use of only a single intercept and/or slope (as in the left panel in the figure below), while mixed effects models have intercepts for each level of a random effect. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this would mean that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker (in addition to the overall intercept that is shown as an orange line in the figure below). \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/lmm1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe idea behind regression analysis is expressed formally in the equation below where$f_{(x)}$ is the y-value we want to predict, $\\alpha$ is the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0), $\\beta$ is the coefficient (the slope of the regression line), and x is the value of a predictor (e.g. 180cm - if we would like to predict the weight of a person based on their height). The $\\epsilon$ is an error term that reflects the difference between the predicted value and the (actually) observed value ($\\epsilon$ is thus a residual that is important as regressions assume that residuals are, e.g., normally distributed). \n\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn other words, to estimate how much some weights who is 180cm tall, we would multiply the coefficient (slope of the line) with 180 ($x$) and add the value of the intercept (point where line crosses the y-axis  at x = 0). \n\nThe equation below represents a formal representation of a mixed-effects regression with varying intercepts [see @winter2019statistics, 235].\n\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta x + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn this random intercept model, each level of a random variable has a different intercept. To predict the value of a data point, we would thus take the appropriate intercept value (the model intercept + the intercept of the random effect) and add the product of the predictor coefficient and the value of x. \n\nFinally, the equation below represents a formal representation of a mixed-effects regression with varying intercepts and varying slopes [see @winter2019statistics, 235].\n\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{(x)} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}x + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn this last model, each level of a random variable has a different intercept and a different slope. To predict the value of a data point, we would thus take the appropriate intercept value (the model intercept + the intercept of the random effect) and add the coefficient of that random effect level multiplied by the value of x. \n\n### Random Effects{-}\n\n*Random Effects* can be visualized using two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to fixed-effects models, that have only 1 intercept and one slope (left panel in the figure above), mixed-effects models can therefore have various *random intercepts* (center panel) or various *random slopes*, or both, various *random intercepts* and various *random slopes* (right panel). \n\nWhat features do distinguish random and fixed effects? \n\n1) Random effects represent a higher level variable under which data points are grouped. This implies that random effects must be categorical (or nominal but *they a´cannot be continuous*!) [see @winter2019statistics, p. 236].\n\n2) Random effects represent a sample of an infinite number of possible levels. For instance, speakers, trials, items, subjects, or words represent a potentially infinite pool of elements from which many different samples can be drawn. Thus, random effects represent a random sample sample. Fixed effects, on the other hand, typically do not represent a random sample but a fixed set of variable levels (e.g. Age groups, or parts-of-speech).\n\n3) Random effects typically represent many different levels while fixed effects typically have only a few. @zuur2013beginner propose that a variable may be used as a fixed effect if it has less than 5 levels while it should be treated as a random effect if it has more than 10 levels. Variables with 5 to 10 levels can be used as both. However, this is a rule of thumb and ignores the theoretical reasons (random sample and nestedness) for considering something as a random effect and it also is at odds with the way that repeated measures are models (namely as mixed effects) although they typically only have very few levels.  \n\n4) Fixed effects represent an effect that if we draw many samples, the effect would be consistent across samples [@winter2019statistics] while random effects should vary for each new sample that is drawn.\n\nIn the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires larger data sets (but have a better fit because intercepts are not forced to be parallel and the lines therefore have a better fit). You should, however, always think about what random effects structure is appropriate for your model - a very recommendable explanation of how to chose which random effects structure is best (and about what the determining factors for this decision are) is give in @winter2019statistics[241-244]. Also, consider the center and the right plots above to understand what is meant by *random intercepts* and *random slopes*.\n\nAfter adding random intercepts, predictors (or fixed effects) are added to the model (just like with multiple regression). So mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.\n\nIn terms of general procedure, random effects are added first, and only after we have ascertained that including random effects is warranted, we test whether including fixed-effects is warranted [@field2012discovering]. We test whether including random effects is warranted by comparing a model, that bases its estimates of the depended variable solely on the base intercept (the mean), with a model, that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the intercepts of the random effect. If the random-effect model explains significantly more variance than the simple model without random effect structure, then we continue with the mixed-effects model. In other words, including random effects is justified if they reduce residual deviance.\n\n### Example: Preposition Use across Time by Genre{-}\n\nTo explore how to implement a mixed-effects model in R we revisit the preposition data that contains relative frequencies of prepositions in English texts written between 1150 and 1913. As a first step, and to prepare our analysis, we load necessary R packages, specify options, and load as well as provide an overview of the data.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load

function from the `lme4` package [@lme4] with Genre as a random effect.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate models\nm0.glm <- glm(Prepositions ~ 1, family = gaussian, data = lmmdata)\nm0.lmer = lmer(Prepositions ~ 1 + (1|Genre), REML = T, data = lmmdata)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have created the base-line models, we will test whether including a random effect structure is mathematically justified. It is important to note here that we are not going to test if including a random effect structure is theoretically motivated but simply if it causes a decrease in variance.\n\n\n### Testing Random Effects{-}\n\nAs a first step in the modeling process, we now need to determine whether or not including a random effect structure is justified. We do so by comparing the AIC of the base-line model without random intercepts to the AIC of the model with random intercepts. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAIC(logLik(m0.glm))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4718.19031114\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAIC(logLik(m0.lmer))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4497.77554693\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe inclusion of a random effect structure with random intercepts is justified as the AIC of the model with random intercepts is substantially lower than the AIC of the model without random intercepts. \n\nWhile I do not how how to *test* if including a random effect is justified, there are often situations, which require to test exactly which random effect structure is best. When doing this, it is important to use *restricted\nmaximum likelihood* (`REML = TRUE` or `method = REML`) rather than maximum likelihood [see @pinheiro2000mixedmodels; @winter2019statistics, 226].\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate models with 2 different random effect structures\nma.lmer = lmer(Prepositions ~ Date + (1|Genre), REML = T, data = lmmdata)\nmb.lmer = lmer(Prepositions ~ Date + (1 + Date | Genre), REML = T, data = lmmdata)\n# compare models\nanova(ma.lmer, mb.lmer, test = \"Chisq\", refit = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nData: lmmdata\nModels:\nma.lmer: Prepositions ~ Date + (1 | Genre)\nmb.lmer: Prepositions ~ Date + (1 + Date | Genre)\n        npar         AIC         BIC       logLik    deviance    Chisq Df\nma.lmer    4 4499.148092 4516.292084 -2245.574046 4491.148092            \nmb.lmer    6 4486.699509 4512.415498 -2237.349755 4474.699509 16.44858  2\n        Pr(>Chisq)    \nma.lmer               \nmb.lmer 0.00026806 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe model comparison shows that the model with the more complex random effect structure has a significantly better fit to the data compared with the model with the simpler random effect structure. However, we will continue with the model with the simpler structure because this is just an example. \n\n\n\n<div class=\"warning\" style='padding:0.1em; background-color:#f2f2f2; color:#51247a'>\n<span>\n<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>\n<b>NOTE</b><br><br>In a real analysis, we would switch to a model with random intercepts and random slopes for Genre because it has a significantly better fit to the data.</p>\n<p style='margin-left:1em;'>\n</p></span>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n\n### Model Fitting{-}\n\nAfter having determined that including a random effect structure is justified, we can continue by fitting the model and including diagnostics as we go. Including diagnostics in the model fitting process can save time and prevent relying on models which only turn out to be unstable if we would perform the diagnostics after the fact.\n\nWe begin fitting our model by adding *Date* as a fixed effect and compare this model to our mixed-effects base-line model to see if *Date* improved the model fit by explaining variance and if *Date* significantly correlates with our dependent variable (this means that the difference between the models is the effect (size) of *Date*!)\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1.lmer <- lmer(Prepositions ~ (1|Genre) + Date, REML = T, data = lmmdata)\nanova(m1.lmer, m0.lmer, test = \"Chi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nrefitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nData: lmmdata\nModels:\nm0.lmer: Prepositions ~ 1 + (1 | Genre)\nm1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date\n        npar         AIC         BIC       logLik    deviance  Chisq Df\nm0.lmer    3 4501.947337 4514.805331 -2247.973668 4495.947337          \nm1.lmer    4 4495.017736 4512.161728 -2243.508868 4487.017736 8.9296  1\n        Pr(>Chisq)   \nm0.lmer              \nm1.lmer  0.0028059 **\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nrefitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model with *Date* is the better model (significant p-value and lower AIC). The significant p-value shows that *Date* correlates significantly with *Prepositions* ($\\chi$^2^(1): 8.929600937904, p  = 0.00281) . The $\\chi$^2^ value here is labeled *Chisq* and the degrees of freedom are calculated by subtracting the smaller number of DFs from the larger number of DFs.\n\nWe now test whether *Region* should also be part of the final minimal adequate model. The easiest way to add predictors is by using the `update` function (it saves time and typing).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate model\nm2.lmer <- update(m1.lmer, .~.+ Region)\n# test vifs\ncar::vif(m2.lmer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         Date        Region \n1.20287668037 1.20287668037 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compare models                \nanova(m2.lmer, m1.lmer, test = \"Chi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nrefitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nData: lmmdata\nModels:\nm1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date\nm2.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date + Region\n        npar         AIC         BIC       logLik    deviance   Chisq Df\nm1.lmer    4 4495.017736 4512.161728 -2243.508868 4487.017736           \nm2.lmer    5 4494.624343 4516.054333 -2242.312171 4484.624343 2.39339  1\n        Pr(>Chisq)\nm1.lmer           \nm2.lmer    0.12185\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThree things tell us that *Region* should not be included: \n\n1. the AIC does not decrease, \n\n2. the BIC increases(!), and \n\n3. the p-value is higher than .05. \n\nThis means, that we will continue fitting the model without having *Region* included. Well... not quite - just as a note on including variables: while *Region* is not significant as a main effect, it must still be included in a model if it were part of a significant interaction. To test if this is indeed the case, we fit another model with the interaction between *Date* and *Region* as predictor.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# generate model\nm3.lmer <- update(m1.lmer, .~.+ Region*Date)\n# extract vifs\ncar::vif(m3.lmer)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         Date        Region   Date:Region \n1.96923042279 1.20324697637 1.78000887980 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compare models                \nanova(m3.lmer, m1.lmer, test = \"Chi\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nrefitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nData: lmmdata\nModels:\nm1.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date\nm3.lmer: Prepositions ~ (1 | Genre) + Date + Region + Date:Region\n        npar         AIC         BIC       logLik    deviance   Chisq Df\nm1.lmer    4 4495.017736 4512.161728 -2243.508868 4487.017736           \nm3.lmer    6 4496.124872 4521.840861 -2242.062436 4484.124872 2.89286  2\n        Pr(>Chisq)\nm1.lmer           \nm3.lmer    0.23541\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the high p-value and the increase in AIC and BIC show that we have found our minimal adequate model with only contains *Date* as a main effect.

Due to the presence of outliers in the data, weights were included into the model which led to a significantly improved model fit compared to an un-weight model ($\\chi$^2^(2): 39.17, p: 0.0006). The final minimal adequate model performed significantly better than an intercept-only base-line model ($\\chi$^2^(1): 12.44, p =.0004) and showed that the frequency of prepositions increases significantly but only marginally with the date of composition (Estimate: 0.02, CI: 0.01-0.03, p < .001, marginal R^2^ =  0.0174, conditional R^2^ =  0.4324). Neither the region where the text was composed nor a higher order interaction between genre and region significantly correlated with the use of prepositions in the data. \n\n### Remarks on Prediction{-}\n\nWhile the number of intercepts, the model reports, and the way how mixed- and fixed-effects arrive at predictions differ, their predictions are extremely similar and almost identical (at least when dealing with a simple random effect structure). Consider the following example where we create analogous fixed and mixed effect models and plot their predicted frequencies of prepositions per genre across the un-centered date of composition. The predictions of the mixed-effects model are plotted as a solid red line, while the predictions of the fixed-effects model are plotted as dashed blue lines.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create lm model\nm5.lmeunweight <- lm(Prepositions ~ DateUnscaled + Genre, data = lmmdata)\nlmmdata$lmePredictions <- fitted(m5.lmeunweight, lmmdata)\nm5.lm <- lm(Prepositions ~ DateUnscaled + Genre, data = lmmdata)\nlmmdata$lmPredictions <- fitted(m5.lm, lmmdata)\n# plot predictions\nggplot(lmmdata, aes(x = DateUnscaled, y = lmePredictions, group = Genre)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = lmmdata$lmePredictions), linetype = \"solid\", color = \"red\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y = lmmdata$lmPredictions), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Genre, nrow = 4) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Date of composition\") +\n  labs(y = \"Prepositions per 1,000 words\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 220))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/lmm29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe predictions overlap almost perfectly which means that the predictions of both are almost identical - irrespective of whether genre is part of the mixed or the fixed effects structure. \n\n## Mixed-Effects Binomial Logistic Regression{-}\n\nWe now turn to an extension of binomial logistic regression: mixed-effects binomial logistic regression. As is the case with linear mixed-effects models logistic mixed effects models have the following advantages over simpler statistical tests: \n\n* Mixed-effects models are multivariate, i.e. they test the effect of several predictors simultaneously while controlling for the effect of all other predictors. \n\n* Mixed models allow to statistically incorporate within-speaker variability and are thus fit to model hierarchical or nested data structures. This applies if several observations are produced by an individual speaker, for instance.\n\n* Mixed-models provide a wealth of diagnostic statistics which enables us to control e.g. multicollinearity, i.e. correlations between predictors, and to test whether conditions or requirements are violated (e.g. homogeneity of variance, etc.). \n\nMajor disadvantages of regression modeling are that they are prone to producing high $\\beta$-errors [see @johnson2009getting] and that they require rather large data sets. \n\n### Introduction {-}\n\nAs is the case with linear mixed-effects models, binomial logistic mixed-effect models are multivariate analyses that treat data points as hierarchical or grouped in some way. In other words, they take into account that the data is nested in the sense that data points are produced by the same speaker or are grouped by some other characteristics. In mixed-models, hierarchical structures are modelled as *random effects*. If the random effect structure represents speakers then this means that a mixed-model would have a separate intercept and/or slope for each speaker. \n\nRandom Effects in linear models can be visualized using two parameters: the intercept (the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis at x = 0) and the slope (the acclivity of the regression line). In contrast to linear mixed-effects models, random effects differ in the position and the slope of the logistic function that is applied to the likelihood of the dependent variable. Random intercepts (upper right panel) or various random slopes (lower left panel), or both, various random intercepts and various random slopes (lower right panel). In the following, we will only focus on models with random intercepts because this is the by far more common method and because including both random intercepts and random slopes requires huge amounts of data. Consider the Figure below to understand what is meant by *random intercepts*.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blmm1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upper left panel merely shows the logistic curve representing the predictions of a fixed-effects logistic regression with a single intercept and slope. The upper right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts for each level of a grouping variable. The lower left panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with one intercept but random slopes for each level of a grouping variable. The lower right panel shows the logistic curves representing the predictions of a mixed-effects logistic regression with random intercepts and random slopes for each level of a grouping variable.\n\nAfter adding random intercepts, predictors (or fixed effects) are added to the model (just like with multiple regression). So mixed-effects are called mixed-effects because they contain both random and fixed effects.\n\nIn terms of general procedure, random effects are added first, and only after we have ascertained that including random effects is warranted, we test whether including fixed-effects is warranted [@field2012discovering]. We test whether including random effects is warranted by comparing a model, that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the base intercept, with a model that bases its estimates of the dependent variable solely on the intercepts of the random effect. If the mixed-effects model explains significantly more variance than the fixed-effects model without random effect structure, then we continue with the mixed-effects model. In other words, including random effects is justified.\n\n### Example: Discourse LIKE in Irish English{-}\n\nIn this example we will investigate which factors correlate with the use of *final discourse like* (e.g. \"*The weather is shite, like!*\") in Irish English. The data set represents speech units in a corpus that were coded for the speaker who uttered a given speech unit, the gender (Gender: Men versus Women) and age of that speaker (Age: Old versus Young), whether the interlocutors were of the same or a different gender (ConversationType: SameGender  versus MixedGender), and whether another *final discourse like* had been used up to three speech units before (Priming: NoPrime versus Prime), whether or not the speech unit contained an *final discourse like* (SUFLike: 1 = yes, 0 = no. To begin with, we load the data and inspect the structure of the data set,\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data\nmblrdata  <-

and the minimum number of observations per random effect level are in order.\n\nWhile many data points per random variable level increases statistical power and thus to more robust estimates of the random effects [@austin2018multilevel], it has been shown that small numbers of observations per random effect variable level do not cause serious bias and it does not negatively affect the estimates of the fixed-effects coefficients  [@bell2008multilevel; @clarke2008can; @clarke2007addressing; @maas2005sufficient]. The minimum number of observations per random effect variable level is therefore 1.\n\nIn simulation study, [@bell2008multilevel] tested the impact of random variable levels with only a single observation ranging from 0 to 70 percent. As long as there was a relatively high number of random effect variable levels (500 or more), small numbers of observations had almost no impact on bias and Type 1 error control.\n\nWe now plot the data to inspect the relationships within the data set. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(mblrdata, aes(Gender, SUFlike, color = Priming)) +\n  facet_wrap(Age~ConversationType) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\") +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2) +\n  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 10)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Observed Probabilty of discourse like\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray20\", \"gray70\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blmm8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe upper left panel in the Figure above indicates that men use discourse *like* more frequently than women. The center right panel suggests that priming significantly increases the likelihood of discourse like being used. The center left panel suggests that speakers use discourse like more frequently in mixed-gender conversations.  However, the lower right panel indicates an interaction between gender and conversation type as women appear to use discourse like less frequently in same gender conversations while the conversation type does not seem to have an effect on men. After visualizing the data, we will now turn to the model building process.\n\n### Model Building{-}\n\nAs a first step, we need to define contrasts and use the `datadist` function to store aspects of our variables that can be accessed later when plotting and summarizing the model. Contrasts define what and how variable levels should be compared and therefore influences how the results of the regression analysis are presented. In this case, we use treatment contrasts which are in-built. Treatment contrasts mean that we assess the significance of levels of a predictor against a baseline which is the reference level of a predictor. @field2012discovering [414-427] and @gries2021statistics provide very good and accessible explanations of contrasts and how to manually define contrasts if you would like to know more.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set options\noptions(contrasts  =c(\"contr.treatment\", \"contr.poly\"))\nmblrdata.dist <- datadist(mblrdata)\noptions(datadist = \"mblrdata.dist\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a next step, we generate fixed-effects minimal base-line models and a base-line mixed-model using the `glmer` function with a random intercept for ID (a lmer-object of the final minimal adequate model will be created later).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# baseline model glm\nm0.glm = glm(SUFlike ~ 1, family = binomial, data = mblrdata) \n# base-line mixed-model\nm0.glmer = glmer(SUFlike ~ (1|ID), data = mblrdata, family = binomial) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Testing the Random Effect{-}\n\nNow, we check if including the random effect is permitted by comparing the AICs from the glm to AIC from the glmer model. If the AIC of the glmer object is smaller than the AIC of the glm object, then this indicates that including random intercepts is justified.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naic.glmer <- AIC(logLik(m0.glmer))\naic.glm <- AIC(logLik(m0.glm))\naic.glmer; aic.glm\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1828.49227107\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1838.17334856\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe AIC of the glmer object is smaller which shows that including the random intercepts is justified. To confirm whether the AIC reduction is sufficient for justifying the inclusion of a random-effect structure, we also test whether the mixed-effects minimal base-line model explains significantly more variance by applying a Model Likelihood Ratio Test to the fixed- and the mixed effects minimal base-line models.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# test random effects\nnull.id = -2 * logLik(m0.glm) + 2 * logLik(m0.glmer)\npchisq(as.numeric(null.id), df=1, lower.tail=F) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.000631389572435\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# sig m0.glmer better than m0.glm\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value of the Model Likelihood Ratio Test is lower than .05 which shows that the inclusion of the random-effects structure is warranted. We can now continue with the model fitting process.\n\n### Model Fitting{-}\n\nThe next step is to fit the model which means that we aim to find the *best* model, i.e. the minimal adequate model. In this case, we will use the `glmulti` package to find the model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of all possible models. We add ´control = glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")´ to avoid unnecessary failures to converge.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# wrapper function for linear mixed-models\nglmer.glmulti <- function(formula,data, random=\"\",...){\n  glmer(paste(deparse(formula),random), \n        family = binomial, \n        data=data, \n        control=glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"), ...)\n}\n# define formula\nform_glmulti = as.formula(paste(\"SUFlike ~ Gender + Age + ConversationType + Priming\"))\n# multi selection for glmer\nmfit <- glmulti(form_glmulti,random=\"+(1 | ID)\", \n                data = mblrdata, method = \"h\", fitfunc = glmer.glmulti,\n                crit = \"bic\", intercept = TRUE, marginality = FALSE, level = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nInitialization...\nTASK: Exhaustive screening of candidate set.\nFitting...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nAfter 50 models:\nBest model: SUFlike~1+Gender+ConversationType+Priming\nCrit= 1696.5877339969\nMean crit= 1753.96253323424\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blmm13a-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nAfter 100 models:\nBest model: SUFlike~1+Gender+ConversationType+Priming\nCrit= 1696.5877339969\nMean crit= 1731.89001011587\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/blmm13a-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCompleted.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extract the best 5 models (best is here defined as the models with the lowest BIC).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract best models\ntop <- weightable(mfit)\ntop <- top[1:5,]\n# inspect top 5 models\ntop\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                                                                                          model\n1                                             SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + ConversationType + Priming\n2                            SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + ConversationType + Priming + Priming:Gender\n3 SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + ConversationType + Priming + Priming:Gender + Priming:ConversationType\n4                                               SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + Priming + Priming:Gender\n5                  SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + ConversationType + Priming + Priming:ConversationType\n            bic         weights\n1 1696.58773400 0.2567900971793\n2 1696.76989551 0.2344349735686\n3 1696.76989551 0.2344349735686\n4 1699.62465884 0.0562494681405\n5 1699.83927868 0.0505259299850\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe best model is has the formula `SUFlike ~ 1 + Gender + ConversationType + Priming` and we take this to be our final minimal adequate model, i.e. the most parsimonious model (the model which explains the relatively most variance with lowest number of predictors).

Somers’ D~xy~ is a value that represents a rank correlation between predicted probabilities and observed responses. Somers’ D~xy~ values range between 0, which indicates complete randomness, and 1, which indicates perfect prediction [@baayen2008analyzing 204]. The C.value of 0.760226203516 suggests that the model has some predictive and explanatory power, but not at an optimal level.

with Mandarin speakers drinking the fewest shots.\n\nIn the present case, we will a Boruta variable selection procedure to streamline the model fitting process. Thus, before fitting the model, we will test which variables have any kind of relationship with the dependent variable and therefore deserve to be evaluated in the regression modeling. As this is just an example, we will only consider variables which are deemed important and disregard both unimportant and tentative variables. We start the Boruta analysis by setting a seed and running an initial Boruta analysis.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# perform variable selection\nset.seed(20191220)\nboruta <- Boruta(UHM ~.,data=countdata)\nprint(boruta)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBoruta performed 99 iterations in 2.79168200493 secs.\n 2 attributes confirmed important: Language, Shots;\n 1 attributes confirmed unimportant: Gender;\n 1 tentative attributes left: Trial;\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs only Shots is confirmed as important, we will only check for the effect of Shots and include Language as a random effect in the regression modeling. Including Language as a random effect is probably not justified statistically (given that the Boruta analysis showed that it only has a tentative effect) but for theoretical reasons as the speakers are nested into Languages. Before we start with the modeling, however, we proceed by checking if the data does indeed approximate a Poisson distribution. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# output the results\ngf = goodfit(countdata$UHM,type= \"poisson\", method= \"ML\")\nplot(gf, main=\"Count data vs Poisson distribution\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/pmm5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe data does not perfectly match a distribution that would be expected if the data approximated a Poisson distribution. We will use a goodness-of-fit test to check if the data does indeed diverge significantly from being Poisson distributed. If the p-values of the goodness-of-fit test is smaller than .05, then the distribution of the data differs significantly from a Poisson distribution and, given the visualization is likely over-dispersed. \n\nIn case of overdispersion, we may have to use a quasi-Poisson or, even better, a negative binomial model but we will, for now continue with the Poisson model and perform diagnostics later to check if we have to switch to a more robust method. \nOne effect of overdispersion is that the standard errors of a model are biased and quasi-Poisson models scale the standard errors to compensate bias. However, @zuur2013beginner suggest to use negative-binomial model instead. This is so because the scaling of the standard errors performed by quasi-Poisson models only affects the significance of coefficients (the p-values) but it does not affect the coefficients which, however, may be affected themselves by overdispersion. Thus, the coefficients of Poisson as well as quasi-Poisson models (which are identical) may be unreliable when dealing with overdispersion. Negative binomial models, in contrast, include an additional dispersion or heterogeneity parameter which accommodates overdispersion better than merely scaling the standard errors [see @zuur2013beginner 21].\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(gf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\t Goodness-of-fit test for poisson distribution\n\n                           X^2 df                                     P(> X^2)\nLikelihood Ratio 153.422771085  5 0.000000000000000000000000000000249336691328\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value is indeed smaller than .05 which means that we should indeed use a negative-binomial model rather than a Poisson model.

Poisson models are based on the Poisson distribution which is defined as a distribution where the variance is equal to the mean (which is very restrictive and not often the case). Quasi-Poisson models scale the standard errors which has a positive effect when dealing with overdispersed data. \n\nTherefore, when the variance is greater than the mean, a Quasi-Poisson model, which assumes that the variance is a linear function of the mean, is more appropriate as it handles over-dispersed data better than normal Poisson-models. \n\nWe begin the model fitting process by creating a mixed- and a fixed-effects intercept-only base-line model. Unfortunately, there is not yet a procedure in place for quasi-Poisson models to test if the inclusion of random effects is justified. However, here the Boruta also provides valuable information: Language was only considered tentative but not important which suggests that it will not explain variance which means that including Language as a random effect may not be justified. This would require further inspection. Because we are only dealing with an example here, we ignore this fact (which you should not do in proper analyses) and continue right away with adding shots. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# base-line mixed-model\nm0.qp = glmmPQL(UHM ~ 1, random = ~ 1 | Language, data = countdata, \n                   family = quasipoisson(link='log'))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\niteration 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\niteration 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\niteration 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\niteration 4\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add Shots\nm1.qp <- update(m0.qp, .~.+ Shots)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\niteration 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAnova(m1.qp, test = \"Chi\")           # SIG!

However, this tutorial focuses merely on how to implement a Negative Binomial Mixed-Effects Regression and we thus continue with generating diagnostic plots to check for problems.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiag_data <- data.frame(PearsonResiduals, fitted(m1.nb)) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(Pearson = 1,\n                Fitted = 2)\np9 <- ggplot(diag_data, aes(x = Fitted, y = Pearson)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\")\np10 <- ggplot(countdata, aes(x = Shots, y = diag_data$Pearson)) +\n  geom_point()  +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(y = \"Pearson\")\np11 <- ggplot(countdata, aes(x = Language, y = diag_data$Pearson)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Pearson\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p9, p10, p11, nrow = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](regression_files/figure-html/nbmm4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe diagnostics show patterning similar to the one we saw with the Poisson model which suggest that the negative binomial model is also not an optimal model for our data.

We will now summarize the results as if the violations had NOT occurred(!) - again: this is only because we are practicing here - this would be absolutely unacceptable in a proper write-up of an analysis!\n\n\nA mixed-effect negative binomial regression model which contained the language in which the conversation took place as random effect was fit to the data. Prior to the regression modeling, a Boruta analysis was applied to determine whether any of the predictors had a meaningful relationship with the dependent variable (instances of *uhm*). Since the Boruta analysis indicated that only the number of shots a speaker had was important, only \"Shots\" was tested during model fitting. The final minimal adequate model showed that the number of *uhm* as fillers increases significantly, and near-linearly with the number of shots speakers had ($\\chi$^2^(1):83.0, p <.0001, $\\beta$: 0.2782). An inspection of the random effect structure conveyed that there was almost no variability between languages and language did not contribute meaningfully to the model fit.\n\n## Mixed-Effects Multinomial Regression{-}\n\nIn this section, we will focus on how to implement a mixed-effects multinomial regression model using the `mblogit` function from the `mclogit` package [see @mclogit]. As we have already gone though model fitting and model validation procedures above, we will strictly see how to implement this type of model here - we will not go through all the other steps that a proper regression analysis would require.\n\nWe begin the analysis by loading the example data set. The data represents observations gathered during an experiment where speakers had to report what they saw. The responses are categorized into four groups: \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# description data\npict  <- base::readRDS(url(\"https://slcladal.github.io/data/pict.rda\", \"rb\"))\n# inspect\nhead(pict)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Id Participant       Group Item     Response Gender Age\n1  1        G001 German_Mono    1  NumeralNoun   Male  18\n2  2        G002 German_Mono    3  NumeralNoun   Male  18\n3  3        G003 German_Mono    4  NumeralNoun   Male  18\n4  4        G004 German_Mono    6 QuantAdjNoun   Male  18\n5  5        G005 German_Mono    8  NumeralNoun   Male  18\n6  6        G006 German_Mono    9 QuantAdjNoun   Male  18\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a first step, we generate a baseline model that we call `m0`. This model only contains the random effect structure and the intercept as the sole predictor.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm0.mn <- mblogit(formula = Response ~ 1, \n              random = ~ 1 | Participant, \n              data = pict)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 1 - deviance = 2452.16571809 - criterion = 0.840346812509\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 2 - deviance = 2412.75547122 - criterion = 0.0646013613319\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 3 - deviance = 2411.26894466 - criterion = 0.00534731178597\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 4 - deviance = 2411.2582473 - criterion = 0.0000446387422471\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 5 - deviance = 2411.25823534 - criterion = 0.0000000031405953873\nconverged\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the algorithm did not converge properly - if this were a real analysis, we could not simply continue but would have to inspect possible causes for this. However, as this is just a showcase, we will ignore this and move on. Next, we add the fixed effects (Gender and Group).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1.mn <- mblogit(formula = Response ~ Gender + Group, \n              random = ~ 1 | Item, \n              data = pict)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 1 - deviance = 1652.54499424 - criterion = 0.800708039017\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 2 - deviance = 1571.22116522 - criterion = 0.0814899820197\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 3 - deviance = 1551.91023391 - criterion = 0.0274469746195\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 4 - deviance = 1547.29823345 - criterion = 0.00512667078353\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 5 - deviance = 1546.02170442 - criterion = 0.000173543402508\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 6 - deviance = 1545.8333116 - criterion = 0.000000244926398008\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nIteration 7 - deviance = 1545.82769259 - criterion = 0.000000000000785569845713\nconverged\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can compare the models to see if including the fixed-effects into the model has significantly improved the model fit.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(m0.mn, m1.mn)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\nModel 1: Response ~ 1\nModel 2: Response ~ Gender + Group\n  Resid.
