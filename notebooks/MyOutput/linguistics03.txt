in the early 20th century, ferdinand de saussure distinguished between the notions of langue and parole in his formulation of structural linguistics. according to him, parole is the specific utterance of speech, whereas langue refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language. this distinction resembles the one made by noam chomsky between competence and performance in his theory of transformative or generative grammar. according to chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in saussure's langue), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., parole, in saussurean terms).
