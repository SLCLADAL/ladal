linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined. research on language through the sub-branches of historical and evolutionary linguistics also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended period of time. language documentation combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. lexicography involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. computational linguistics is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language education ï¿½ the teaching of a second or foreign language. policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.
